Because the independents have made that very clear.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThese are not matters that go to issues of confidence. I don\u8217\'20\'19t consider them in those terms. The government has never put them in those terms.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 7:00pm\par \par \uc2 BILL SHORTEN REACTS\par \par \uc2 6:50pm\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Andrew Wilkie\uc2 , who voted for the bill, has released a statement. He sounds like he\u8217\'20\'19s just getting started.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe passing of the medical transfers bill is wonderful news for sick asylum seekers and refugees incarcerated in Nauru and on Manus Island,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhile offshore processing remains systemically cruel and illegal, at least this reform goes some genuine way to limit the cruelty and provide an alternative pathway to the court system.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CToday\u8217\'20\'19s vote is also a triumph for our democratic system because the parliament worked as it should. A majority of members represented their communities and worked cooperatively in the public interest.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBut this is just the beginning. The inhumanity and illegality will only ever be fully remedied when offshore processing is abolished, and when we\u8217\'20\'19ve put an end to the other diabolical elements of Labor and Liberal policy like mandatory detention, towbacks and temporary visas.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 6:35pm\par \par \uc2 ABBOTT: \u8216\'20\'18PEOPLE SMUGGLERS THE WINNERS\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Tony Abbott has reacted to the vote.\par \par \uc2 Scott Morrison has called a press conference at 7pm.\par \par \uc2 6:15pm\par \par \uc2 GOVERNMENT SUFFERS HISTORIC DEFEAT\par \par \uc2 And that\u8217\'20\'19s it. By a margin of 75-74, the House has voted to agree to the medical transfer bill with all the amendments.\par \par \uc2 Now the bill has to go back to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 This is historic \u8212\'20\'14 it is the first time a government has lost a substantive policy vote on the floor of the House since 1941.\par \par \uc2 On that occasion, parliament voted to change Prime Minister Arthur Fadden\u8217\'20\'19s budget by just one pound. Mr Fadden then resigned.\par \par \uc2 6:05pm\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18IT WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD\u8217\'20\'19\par \par \uc2 Scott Morrison himself stood to argue against Mr Shorten\u8217\'20\'19s motion, and he got properly fired up.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHere we are again. How many elections? How many times have the people of Australia said so clearly that they want their borders secure? How many times has the Labor Party failed them on this issue?\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Morrison said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI will not stand here and let this parliament give itself the excuse to weaken the border protection framework that has saved lives.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mr Morrison said he remembered Labor\u8217\'20\'19s policy when \uc2 Kevin Rudd\uc2  became prime minister.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThen the vile trade opened. And the deaths started. And the bodies mounted up, month after month, week after week, and our border protection staff had to pull children out of the water,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNow the same wreckers who destroyed it last time have come into this place and whispered in the ears of those who sit on the crossbench and they have convinced them to undermine it again.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe will not allow the parliament to delude itself, or the Labor Party to delude itself, that there is a safe version of this bill for border protection.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe Labor Party broke this system and we have fixed it. And now even in opposition they will seek to break it again.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CTheir humanitarianism, as supposed last time, led to child deaths. It led to the total destruction of our borders.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe people of Australia will remember this day, and know that this is now on your head,\u8221\'20\'1D he told Mr Shorten.\par \par \uc2 5:55pm\par \par \uc2 PYNE INVOKES ENGLISH CIVIL WAR\par \par \uc2 The substantive debate is happening now.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Pyne\uc2 , shouting himself hoarse, warned Labor it would \u8220\'20\'1Crue the day\u8221\'20\'1D it abrogated responsibility to the Senate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThey don\u8217\'20\'19t care about the Australian constitution, that they don\u8217\'20\'19t care about the Westminster traditions that form the basis of our constitution,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI will remind the House that the English fought a civil war over this matter.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe civil war was over the right of the parliament or the king to make an appropriation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 That war happened hundreds of years ago, incidentally. King Charles I tried to implement a ship tax, the parliament didn\u8217\'20\'19t like that, and war ensued.\par \par \uc2 After that, Bill Shorten moved that the Senate amendments be agreed to.

Scott Morrison twice wrote to Thailand\u8217\'20\'19s prime minister to request he intervene.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe actually did a fabulous job.

It is our money \u8212\'20\'14 all of us. We are giving away billions of dollars in a tax loophole by giving a refund to people who don\u8217\'20\'19t pay any tax. Only four per cent of Australians benefit from this tax loophole, but all of us pay for it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 She said 80 per cent of the benefit from franking credits went to the richest 20 per cent of retirees.\par \par \uc2 And she labelled the questioner, Mr Dye, a \u8220\'20\'1CYoung Liberal plant\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Sky News hosts Kieran Gilbert and Laura Jayes discussed the moment this morning.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe point is, it\u8217\'20\'19s fine for Liberals and Labor people to ask questions or whatever, but setups like this, particularly in an election campaign as we approach this period, can blow up in your face,\u8221\'20\'1D Gilbert said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf it\u8217\'20\'19s too choreographed, in campaigns where people try to be too clever by half, put a plant in and then it\u8217\'20\'19s exposed, it can just look a bit too tricky.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Jayes brought up the controversy over the parliamentary economic committee\u8217\'20\'19s inquiry into the franking credits policy.

Dr Phelps has said she will take a \u8220\'20\'1Clevel-headed, methodical approach\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The government has made it clear it will not vote for the bill in any form, so Labor will need the support of all those crossbenchers.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 gpol : \uc2 Domestic Politics | gsec : \uc2 State Security Measures/Policies | gimm : \uc2 Human Migration | gvexe : \uc2 Executive Branch | gcat : \uc2 Political/General News | gcns : \uc2 National/Public Security | gpir : \uc2 Politics/International Relations | gvbod : \uc2 Government Bodies\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 austr : \uc2 Australia | sydney : \uc2 Sydney | apacz : \uc2 Asia Pacific | ausnz : \uc2 Australia/Oceania | nswals : \uc2 New South Wales\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IPD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 medical treatment | Kym Smith | methodical approach | Bill Shorten | Andrew Wilkie | transfer recommendation | asylum seeker bill | refugee sector | Thailand | Oceania | asylum seeker medivac | Scott Morrison | asylum seekers | medical transfer | Cathy McGowan | government minders | async src | Kerryn Phelps | border experts | Australia and New Zealand | Adam Bandt | blockquote class | refugee footballer | refugee advocates | medical transfer rules | Asia | South-eastern Asia | Sky News Australia | asylum seeker | criminal record | Australia | leaders spoke\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 News Ltd.\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document NLNEWW0020190212ef2c005v5\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\bkmkstart toc8}{\*\bkmkend toc8}{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255

For procedural reasons, this needs 76 votes, one more than the 75 required on the medical transfer bill. The government has been leaning heavily on Bob Katter, the crossbencher who will be the key.\par \par \uc2 While the government looked rattled as the votes on the medical\par \par \uc2 transfer bill proceeded, Labor was calm and steely.\par \par \uc2 For all the talk about Labor\u8217\'20\'19s misjudgement on the issue, this week it has moved cautiously and methodically.\par \par \uc2 Originally pushed by the crossbench into taking a stand on\par \par \uc2 humanitarian grounds \u8211\'20\'13 the bill is based on a proposal from\par \par \uc2 independent \uc2 Kerryn Phelps\uc2  - Labor has sought to display compassion but contain the political risk.\par \par \uc2 Bill Shorten, knowing the danger, decided the version of the bill\par \par \uc2 coming from the Senate (which Labor had supported there) left the ALP too exposed. He flagged last week he\u8217\'20\'19d like a \u8220\'20\'1Cmiddle\u8221\'20\'1D course.\par \par \uc2 So the opposition came up with amendments to give the minister wider discretion and more time in making decisions, and to limit the application of the legislation to those on Nauru and Manus now. The latter change was to minimise the \u8220\'20\'1Cpull\u8221\'20\'1D factor \u8211\'20\'13 the extent to which the new arrangement would encourage the people smugglers.\par \par \uc2 Then it was a matter of persuading the required six crossbenchers.\par \par \uc2 They accepted in the negotiations that a modified bill was better than nothing (though there was some Greens cavilling).\par \par \uc2 In the House, the ALP troops were kept carefully in check; the emotion was turned down; the speeches from the bill\u8217\'20\'19s supporters were few and brief. Labor just wanted one thing in the chamber \u8211\'20\'13 a win. This wasn\u8217\'20\'19t the time to grandstand.\par \par \uc2 The government, wounded and worried, is seeing this as one (albeit\par \par \uc2 major) battle in the long war to the election. Its spruikers will say that in defeat it has had a victory \u8211\'20\'13 that Labor has given the\par \par \uc2 Coalition ammunition for the campaign.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s true the bill has breathed new life into the border security\par \par \uc2 debate, but whether this will be enough to do Labor serious harm is an open question. `\par \par \uc2 The ALP is always vulnerable on boats. On the other hand, boats are lower in voters\u8217\'20\'19 minds than they used to be.\par \par \uc2 The government will turn up the dial by announcing \u8220\'20\'1Ccontingency plans\u8221\'20\'1D against fresh arrivals. Morrison, having accused Shorten of\par \par \uc2 undermining offshore processing, is already moving on to the claim that he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t be trusted to be strong on turnbacks.\par \par \uc2 Goodness knows how the politics would play out if a boat appeared on the horizon in the next few weeks. You can be sure, however, that the government would be quick to tell us about it, and point the finger at Shorten.\par \par \uc2 In all this, the bill itself (which has to go back to the Senate for a tick off on the amendments) should be kept in perspective.\par \par \uc2 The minister has a veto on \u8220\'20\'1Csecurity\u8221\'20\'1D grounds, including being able to exclude anyone who has committed a major crime. The composition of the medical panel which would have the final say on other transfers is broad and balanced.\par \par \uc2 Probably, over a period, there would be a lot of transfers out of the 1000 people offshore. But there have already been nearly 900 (some after legal action). These transfers have amounted to a backdoor route into Australia.\par \par \uc2 If the legislation in the longer term opens that door a little wider, it will also be a way of \u8220\'20\'1Csettling\u8221\'20\'1D people in Australia without acknowledging that is being done.\par \par \uc2 More of the same?

We saw 50,000 people arrive. We saw 8,000 children go into detention and it has taken us six years to clean up Labor\u8217\'20\'19s mess.\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 Are you saying that\u8217\'20\'19s what will happen under Labor\u8217\'20\'19s bill?\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 I believe we will see boats. I think there is no question that people smugglers will be hearing very clearly that the policy in Australia has changed and I think we need to be very cognisant of that. I\u8217\'20\'19ve met tonight already...\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 Sorry to keep interrupting, but I want to pick up on the points that you\u8217\'20\'19re making. But for your theory to be true, people smugglers will have to offer a product like this \u8211\'20\'13 you can get on a boat to Australia, but there is a high chance that you might be turned back, if you\u8217\'20\'19re not turned back, you might be sent to Nauru and Manus. You might be able to get a medical evacuation [if you can get two doctors and a panel to say you need one]. If you get to Australia you might be able to lodge a court action and find yourself staying in Australia [in detention].\par \par \uc2 That doesn\u8217\'20\'19t sound like an attractive product?\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 Well Leigh people are drowning on the Mediterranean. There are 1,200 people who drowned trying to get to Australia last time. That\u8217\'20\'19s the risk...\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 You\u8217\'20\'19re saying as a result of this policy, it is making things more attractive for people to come to Australia. It is an unattractive product.\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 No, this puts Australia back on the map for people smugglers and Bill Shorten has that on his shoulders.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s the reality what we have seen in the House tonight. We have got four kids left on Nauru who packed their bags ready to go to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Nobody in detention on Nauru or Manus. We\u8217\'20\'19ve closed 19 detention centres and Mr Shorten, along with the Greens tonight, has taken a decision that he will unravel that success.\par \par \uc2 He has announced also, I must say, if boats arrive, that those people are going to Manus, going to Nauru. What\u8217\'20\'19s the point of getting people off Manus and Nauru if you\u8217\'20\'19re only to fill them with new arrivals the following week? And I think Mr Shorten doesn\u8217\'20\'19t yet understand the full consequence of his decision tonight, but I think the Australian public do.\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 The bill only applies to people who are currently on Nauru and Manus, how is it going to make it attractive and fill the place?\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 At the last election Bill Shorten was saying there was no difference on Operation Sovereign Borders between the Labor party and the Liberal party...\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 No, that\u8217\'20\'19s not what I asked.\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 The point I\u8217\'20\'19m making is you couldn\u8217\'20\'19t believe what Bill Shorten says when it comes to border protection. He says one thing before the election and he does the opposite after. If Mr Shorten is elected in May, this policy will apply to people newly arrived on Nauru. It will be a disaster. It will put kids back into detention and Mr Shorten will have to explain that failing if he is elected prime minister to the Australian people.\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 Hasn\u8217\'20\'19t the government created this situation for itself by not dealing with the 1,000 people who are on Nauru and Manus?\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 No, that\u8217\'20\'19s false. We have got an arrangement with the United States where we now have about 500 people that have gone there...\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 My point was about the timeliness?\par \par \uc2 Dutton:\par \par \uc2 I would want people off Nauru and Manus. People that have come from Iran and found not to be refugees. We need to settle people in third countries and it was not the Labor party but our government that created the opportunity for people to go to the United States, we\u8217\'20\'19ve not ruled out people going to New Zealand in certain circumstances.\par \par \uc2 So, yes, we\u8217\'20\'19ve dealt with a very difficult situation over a period of time, but we have done it in a way that hasn\u8217\'20\'19t seen kids drown. I haven\u8217\'20\'19t put one child into detention or Nauru. I have got every remaining child, as Scott Morrison stated, out of detention in Australia and I don\u8217\'20\'19t want to go back to those bad Labor days and I worry that Mr Shorten has fired the starting gun again for people smugglers.\par \par \uc2 block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.09am GMT\par \par \uc2 block-time published-time 8.44am GMT\par \par \uc2 enltrThat\u8217\'20\'19s a cheap abrogation.

We brought a significant number of people here either for medical attention or people in a family unit to support the person coming here for medical attention, but I am worried about the consequences of the deal that\u8217\'20\'19s been struck between Mr Shorten and The Greens tonight...\par \par \uc2 Question:\par \par \uc2 Can I interrupt.

Clearly he has failed that very significant test and I think most Australians now see fortunately before the election, unlike the case with Mr Rudd, a Labor party unravelling a successful border protection policy. That\u8217\'20\'19s a disaster for our country.\par \par \uc2 But despite the government saying it is an issue which is detrimental to border security, Dutton says he doesn\u8217\'20\'19t believe it is an issue of \u8216\'20\'18vital importance\u8217\'20\'19, as in an election trigger.\par \par \uc2 We have got kids out of detention. We have medical staff up on Nauru for a population of 400 people.\par \par \uc2 The claims are false in relation to the medical attention that\u8217\'20\'19s required. This is about Mr Shorten trying to appease the left of his party.\par \par \uc2 Mr Shorten has chosen for, you know, the choice between trying to get the politics settled in his own ranks, he has chosen that option over the option of what is in our country\u8217\'20\'19s best interests and I think he stands condemned for his actions tonight.\par \par \uc2 block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.23am GMT\par \par \uc2 block-time published-time 8.34am GMT\par \par \uc2 On the Senate numbers:\par \par \uc2 Labor is a yes.\par \par \uc2 Centre Alliance is a yes.\par \par \uc2 The Greens are a yes.\par \par \uc2 Tim Storer is a yes.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Derryn Hinch was a yes.

That is the first tranche of the border protection framework that we put in place in 2013.\par \par \uc2 They have said that they will abolish that and they will restore providing permanent visas to people who illegally enter Australia.\par \par \uc2 Tonight - and I should say last year - the Labor party voted on that occasion, in the Senate, without even taking any advice when it came to the national security implications to abolish offshore processing as we know it.\par \par \uc2 This is the second tranche of the border protection regime that we have put in place.\par \par \uc2 Now the Labor party may want to think that what they\u8217\'20\'19ve done tonight doesn\u8217\'20\'19t do that and it only demonstrates their lack of understanding about these issues. The Labor party have shown Australia tonight that they cannot be trusted on the second of those core planks of the border protection framework that have been so successful in stopping the deaths, getting the children off Nauru, getting children out of detention, ensuring that we could restore certainty and stability to our refugee and humanitarian intake.\par \par \uc2 So when Bill Shorten tells you and the Labor party tells you that they can be trusted to turn back boats where it\u8217\'20\'19s safe to do so, I think the Australian people got their answer tonight. He can\u8217\'20\'19t be trusted to do that either. The Labor party and the Liberal and National parties are not on the same page when it comes to border protection.\par \par \uc2 There is no bipartisanship on this issue. The Labor party have clearly demonstrated that under Bill Shorten\u8217\'20\'19s leadership. They want to go a different path and what we saw tonight was that, yet again, the Labor party have failed to learn their lessons of failure when they have had responsibility for border protection in this country.\par \par \uc2 They have demonstrated, yet again, that they just don\u8217\'20\'19t understand how to protect Australia\u8217\'20\'19s borders.

Senator Cameron, you are aware that the matter is before the court, so it would be inappropriate to comment, but of course I will absolutely cooperate with the court.\par \par \uc2 Can I just make one small point in relation to what the proceedings themselves are actually about. The proceedings themselves are between the AWU and the Registered Organisations Commission. It is in relation to the proper authorisation of documents and donations made by the AWU to Mr Shorten\u8217\'20\'19s own election campaign and to GetUp. Despite what those on the other side say, that is actually what these proceedings are about. The PRESIDENT: Senator Cameron, a supplementary question.\par \par \uc2 Senator CAMERON : I refer to reports that her former media adviser, Mr De Garis, has today told the court that he was informed in advance of the AWU raids by the minister\u8217\'20\'19s then chief of staff, Mr Davies. Is this correct? When did the minister first become aware of this conversation between Mr De Garis and Mr Davies?\par \par \uc2 Senator CASH : Again, because the matter is before the court, Senator Cameron, it would be completely inappropriate for me to comment.\par \par \uc2 Senator CAMERON: Did the minister have any conversation with her then chief of staff, Mr Davies, on or before 23 October 2017 with regard to foreknowledge of federal police raids on the AWU? Did she at any point in these discussions discuss tipping off the media about these raids?\par \par \uc2 Senator CASH: Again, Senator Cameron, I have answered copious questions at estimates in relation to this matter. But, Mr President, as the matter is before the court, and Senator Cameron well knows this, it would be inappropriate to make further comment. But I do again remind Senator Cameron what the case is about. It is about the proper authorisations of donations made by the AWU to Bill Shorten\u8217\'20\'19s own political campaign and $100,000 to GetUp.

What I\u8217\'20\'19m about to share with you looks backwards.\par \par \uc2 This is where the discussions started this morning, but it\u8217\'20\'19s interesting to be able to snapshot the process at different times.\par \par \uc2 Labor, we know, has flagged three principles it wants adjusted.\par \par \uc2 The first is widening the scope of ministerial discretion to knock back medical transfers.\par \par \uc2 The minister can knock back a transfer on security grounds in the bill as it stands, but Labor wants to expand the scope to include blocking transfers of people with criminal histories.\par \par \uc2 So, again, to be clear, this is where the discussion started early this morning. The bill currently says the home affairs minister must approve the person\u8217\'20\'19s transfer to Australia unless that would be prejudicial to security.\par \par \uc2 The new language says the transfer should be approved \u8220\'20\'1Cunless: the minister, in the minister\u8217\'20\'19s discretion, reasonably believes that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security within the meaning of the \uc2 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation\uc2  Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 A second criteria has been added.\par \par \uc2 The transfer should be approved unless \u8220\'20\'1Cthe minister knows or, in the minister\u8217\'20\'19s discretion, reasonably suspects that the person has a substantial criminal record (as defined by subsection 501(7))\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The second principle Labor is pursuing is time frames for determinations. The original bill said determinations be made within 24 hours. The amendment proposed this morning said omit within 24 hours and substitute \u8220\'20\'1CAs soon as practicable after\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 The word from the bunker is the parties are now back to a specific time frame, rather than as soon as practicable. I\u8217\'20\'19ve heard 48 hours, but nothing is certain yet.

The officials say a lot of doctors don\u8217\'20\'19t like offshore detention, ipso facto: \u8220\'20\'1CMany doctors in Australia and their professional associations have called for an end to regional processing and it is expected that their recommendations under these amendments would be forthcoming in a short period.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is expected that within four weeks of Royal Assent, should the bill pass the House of Representatives, that most of the 1000 individuals would be in contact with \u8216\'20\'18treating doctors\u8217\'20\'19 willing to recommend their transfer to Australia for at least medical assessment if not treatment. The fact that treatment is available in PNG, Taiwan or Nauru would not restrict the recommendations by treating doctors to transfer. The individual would not be required to accept treatment in their regional processing country or another location that is not Australia.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSome doctors have publically [sic] asserted that all transferees should be removed from Nauru and PNG for mental health reasons. Provided those doctors are appropriately registered or licensed and have \u8216\'20\'18assessed\u8217\'20\'19 transferees either remotely or in person, it will be open to him or her to form the opinion that any or all of the transferees are \u8216\'20\'18relevant transitory persons\u8217\'20\'19 and give the secretary notice of this, triggering the provisions in the amendments.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A contention, unless I\u8217\'20\'19m not mistaken. Doctors. Gotta watch them. Always up to something.\par \par \uc2 Moving on, the briefers note something the government hasn\u8217\'20\'19t exactly highlighted. \u8220\'20\'1COn transfer to Australia, the individuals would be detained under the Migration Act 1958 (Migration Act) and placed in held detention or in community detention by way of a residence determination\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 So this isn\u8217\'20\'19t quite \u8220\'20\'1Ctwo doctors say you can come to Australia, and freedom beckons\u8221\'20\'1D, as a number of government frontbenchers have suggested during the past few hyperbolic days. It\u8217\'20\'19s come to Australia (maybe, if you meet the criteria) and get detained again.\par \par \uc2 Despite the brief confirming medical transferees would continue to be detained, this is framed by the authors as a problem.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPlacing up to 1000 people in held detention will put pressure on the detention network and with risk assessments, some, but not all, may be suitable for community detention. Those not suitable for community detention would be placed in held detention, likely necessitating the stand-up of the Christmas Island facility and removing our hot contingency fall back for Operation Sovereign Borders.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The briefers worry word will get back to the people smugglers. \u8220\'20\'1CThis path to Australia will likely reach people smugglers in a short period and they could rightly advise their clients that if they were sent at a future time to a regional processing location, they would only need to stay long enough to seek the recommendations of \u8216\'20\'18treating doctors\u8217\'20\'19 for transfer to Australia.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe expect that this may encourage those prospective clients of people smugglers who, to date, have not decided to travel due to the dissuasion of returns, turnbacks and regional processing. This bill removes the third pillar \u8211\'20\'13 regional processing\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Sounds bad, but several paragraphs later, the advice becomes more hedged. After noting the softening in Australia will feed in to marketing by people smugglers, the story becomes more complicated. \u8220\'20\'1CAlthough people smugglers may claim there has been a shift in Australian policy and entry to Australia is now possible with just the opinion of two doctors, the resumption of large-scale people smuggling to Australia will remain dependent on a shift in Potential Illegal Immigrant (PII) intent \u8212\'20\'14 not smuggler marketing.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPIIs will probably be interested in any perceived or actual pathway where resettlement in a Western country is guaranteed, even if such a pathway includes a period spent in detention. However, PIIs will probably remain sceptical of smuggler marketing and await proof that such a pathway is viable, or that an actual change of policy has occurred, before committing to ventures.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 block-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.04pm GMT\par \par \uc2 block-time published-time 9.31pm GMT\par \par \uc2 Kerryn Phelps on why she believes Labor blinked and, more importantly, why she believes everyone needs to get moving.\par \par \uc2 I think you would have to speak to Labor about that, because, you know, what their motives are, you\u8217\'20\'19d have to ask them.\par \par \uc2 But certainly I believe that there is a great willingness by many people in parliament to get a resolution to this today, or in the next few days, because, as I said, lives do depend on this.\par \par \uc2 We cannot keep going the way we have been going, where the bureaucrats and the minister just block medical transfers by running them through the courts, by taking them to the federal court, only to find those ministerial decisions overturned and the doctors\u8217\'20\'19 decisions upheld.\par \par \uc2 We need to find the right balance and the right balance is to have medical practitioners making decisions about the medical transfers because they\u8217\'20\'19re saying that they cannot cope on Manus Island and Nauru with particular cases.\par \par \uc2 And the minister does need to have certain veto powers related to security for Australia, and if we can get the wording to everyone\u8217\'20\'19s satisfaction, let\u8217\'20\'19s do that today.\par \par \uc2 block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.58pm GMT\par \par \uc2 block-time published-time 9.29pm GMT\par \par \uc2 Speaking to the ABC, Kerryn Phelps expanded on concerns she has about Labor\u8217\'20\'19s proposed amendment to broaden national security ministerial discretion to include people who have been convicted of a serious crime, when it came to the medical evacuation bill.\par \par \uc2 The first thing is that these people have all been, if they\u8217\'20\'19ve been assessed as refugees under the refugee convention, they cannot have committed a serious crime in their home country.\par \par \uc2 But we also need to look at what the definition of serious crime is, because if for example somebody has committed a crime in their country, which is a political crime, for example, complaining about something their government has done, been involved in a protest, being a human rights protester, a woman who has committed adultery who is sentenced to death by stoning \u8211\'20\'13 these are the sorts of things that might come under serious criminality and so we need to take a very careful look at that definition.\par \par \uc2 And what I\u8217\'20\'19m very keen to do is to avoid being in exactly the same position where we are now, where the minister has excessive veto powers and runs every serious medical case through the courts, only to find that the doctor\u8217\'20\'19s original recommendations were upheld.\par \par \uc2 Most of the people on Manus Island and Nauru have been judged to be refugees \u8211\'20\'13 not just by the UNHCR but also by Australian authorities. And given how long they have spent in our offshore detention centres, there is nothing we don\u8217\'20\'19t know about these people.

We greatly respect the process that they\u8217\'20\'19ve had to work through and we greatly appreciate their listening to the issues that have been raised by our government and many others who have raised this case.\par \par \uc2 These issues are complex and our relationship with the Thai government and in particular with Prime Minister Prayut, is very strong. We thank them for the way that they have engaged with us on this matter now, for some period of time. I also want to thank \u8211\'20\'13 and the foreign minister will add further to this \u8211\'20\'13 all of those Australians who have been so supportive of Hakeem. Those who have provided direct support to him personally, particularly Craig Foster, who has very much championed his case and cause and I have spoken to him and Marise has spoken to him on many occasions, we\u8217\'20\'19ve worked closely together.\par \par \uc2 But there is still a journey ahead, there is still a process to be followed. But we are very grateful for the relationship we have with the Thai government that has enabled us to work through these issues in the way that we have. I particularly want to commend the foreign minister for the work that she has done and that all of our consular officials have done. These issues are very delicate, they\u8217\'20\'19re very sensitive and I think what we\u8217\'20\'19ve seen here is the professionalism of our foreign service on show.

She said her focus was on getting ill people the treatment they need.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat is what this is all about \u8211\'20\'13 getting medical treatment for those people who can\u8217\'20\'19t get medical treatment on Manus Island and Nauru,\u8221\'20\'1D she told Sky News.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSo, if the legislation is confined to that cohort, that might be something that we can look at, but I would have to again speak to the refugee sector about that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 So stay tuned as we follow those developments.\par \par \uc2 Both party leaders are at the traditional beginning of parliament church service this morning, before heading back to parliament where all the morning\u8217\'20\'19s lessons will be promptly forgotten.\par \par \uc2 And we\u8217\'20\'19ll be here documenting it all.
