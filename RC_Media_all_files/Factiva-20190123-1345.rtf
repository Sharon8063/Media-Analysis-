We only saw a couple of per cent increase on those debt levels," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Miller said farmers who had missed out on rain would continue to struggle with financial and personal pressures.\par \par \uc2 "Primary producers have been going through this drought for over six years, it's meant that a lot of them have had extended periods of low income and there's challenges with that, they've had to destock animals," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I think once we see rainfall return and people start to rebuild their herds that will put upward pressure on food prices in supermarkets."\par \par \uc2 Mr Miller said AgForce would like governments to look at rate and rent relief and make some income support was appropriate.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, estimates hearings took a lengthy break on Wednesday morning, after a blow-up about procedural rules and how questions were being asked.\par \par \uc2 It began when member for Gympie Tony Perrett tried to ask when Mr Furner exercised his voice about the "unfair" vegetation management laws.\par \par \uc2 Chair Chris Whiting said the question was not relevant to the Agricultural Industry Development session of the estimates hearings because it came under Natural Resources Minister Anthony Lynham's portfolio.\par \par \uc2 Dr Lynham is due to face estimates hearings on Wednesday afternoon.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 ibnk : \uc2 Banking/Credit | ifinal : \uc2 Financial Services\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 queensl : \uc2 Queensland | austr : \uc2 Australia | apacz : \uc2 Asia Pacific | ausnz : \uc2 Australia/Oceania\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IPD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Queensland | Banking and Finance\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 Fairfax Media Management Pty Limited\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document BRSBTM0020180725ee7p000b5\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw285\pich23\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4275\pichgoal345

A year ago Craig Hutchison suffered the indignity of getting boned from The AFL Footy Show and replaced by Eddie McGuire.\par \par \uc2 But don\u8217\'20\'19t feel too sore for Hutchy.

The media group owns two Melbourne commercial broadcasting licences, with Crocmedia a long-term supplier of sports content to \u173\'00\'ADPacific Star\u8217\'20\'19s SEN.\par \par \uc2 It also has three digital radio stations, talent management arm Bravo and a suite of magazines, including the inner-north Melbourne fashion bible Frankie (which the group acquired when ABC boss \uc2 Michelle Guthrie\uc2  was a director on Pacific Star\u8217\'20\'19s board).\par \par \uc2 Croc also has the commercial radio rights to broadcast Australian cricket, the AFL and the NRL, which it syndicates around the country.\par \par \uc2 And now, with Hutchy at the helm, Pacific Star via Crocmedia has done a deal to buy a quarter of property developer Larry Kestelman\u8217\'20\'19s National Basketball League champion team Melbourne United.\par \par \uc2 Plenty to keep Hutchy busy in his life after Sam Newman.\par \par \uc2 Packer withdrawals\par \par \uc2 The quiet devolution of power in the Packer empire continues as the family retreats from the frontline and places corporate structures in the hands of trusted outsiders.\par \par \uc2 Billionaire Gretel Packer, 52, has withdrawn from a key family investment vehicle, resigning as a director of the longstanding Colodusk.\par \par \uc2 Her even richer younger brother James Packer, 51, resigned as a director of the company the same day.\par \par \uc2 Recent weeks have seen the businessman exit all his Australian corporate directorships.\par \par \uc2 The siblings\u8217\'20\'19 late media mogul father Kerry Packer was a Colodusk director until he died in December 2015, with his children appointed directors of the vehicle in May 2016.\par \par \uc2 Enduring Packer executive Michael Johnston is now its sole director.\par \par \uc2 The reshuffling comes as James Packer enjoys time in the sun with friends aboard his new\par \par \uc2 55m superyacht EJI, last spotted off Ibiza.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile the Taronga Zoo-supporting Gretel\u8217\'20\'19s icebreaker Arctic P is believed to be navigating the bear-festooned islands of the Gulf of Alaska.\par \par \uc2 Changes at the empire have not been confined to profit-making operations.\par \par \uc2 There\u8217\'20\'19s been a subtle change to the philanthropic Packer Family Foundation, whose board has been stable since its inception in mid-2014. The only change has been the exit of investment banker Rob Rankin after his time with James Packer came to a sudden end at the start of last year.\par \par \uc2 Along with family matriarch Ros Packer and daughter Gretel, other heavy-hitting directors include our nation\u8217\'20\'19s first lady Lucy Turnbull, and in-house family advisers Johnston, Mark Arbib, Sam McKay and Guy Jalland.\par \par \uc2 But now outsider Kerrie Corne, 60, has quietly joined \u8212\'20\'14 Corne, like Turnbull, a rare board member who is neither a Packer nor a family employee.\par \par \uc2 As with Turnbull, Corne is well known in Sydney\u8217\'20\'19s east.

None of the big four lenders, which control the bulk of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s mortgage market, have so far moved.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on ABC Radio Mr Thorburn acknowledged big banks were also feeling the pressure.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDeposit costs have gone up and they remain elevated from where they were six months ago,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Thorburn said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThat\u8217\'20\'19s something (interest rates) we have under constant review.

Unless there\u8217\'20\'19s a global or economic shock, which I think is a low likely,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Separately Mr Thorburn said the \b \highlight22\uc2 banking royal commission\b0 \highlight\uc2  had been \u8220\'20\'1Cembarrassing\u8221\'20\'1D for the banking industry and at times made him feel ashamed, but the sector needed to acknowledge where it had got things wrong and be prepared to change.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI have been a banker all my career. I\u8217\'20\'19ve been proud of what we do, but sometimes we get it terribly wrong. When you see some of the things in the royal commission that makes you feel ashamed,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis royal commission is like a burning platform for us.

introduction of offsets for Farm Management Deposits during the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper process in 2014, so we very much welcome this week's announcement from Australia's largest agri-lender, \uc2 NAB\uc2 ," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Offsetting FMDs against other farm loans will enable producers to save on interest costs while also growing their resilience to business risks, including drought or market downturns.\par \par \uc2 READ MORE: More support for drought-affected areas\par \par \uc2 "NAB's decision to no longer charge higher default interest rates on drought-affected farmers who are unable to make their loan repayments is also very welcome.\par \par \uc2 "It is counterproductive and unfair for farmers who are struggling to meet repayments to then be hit by even higher charges, which often contributes to foreclosure actions being taken by the bank.\par \par \uc2 "We congratulate \uc2 NAB\uc2  on the announcements they have made and urge other rural lenders to follow their lead."\par \par \uc2 Mr Maudsley said AgForce was optimistic the current \b \highlight22\uc2 banking Royal Commission\b0 \highlight\uc2  would lead to real action to deliver fair and affordable financing options for Queensland broadacre farmers.\par \par \uc2 "The \b \highlight22\uc2 banking Royal Commission\b0 \highlight\uc2  provides an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the poor practices of the past, while also looking at how the banking sector can work better with farmers to attract more investment and grow their businesses into the future," he said.\par \par \uc2 This week's announcement by \uc2 NAB\uc2  follows a recent drought roundtable chaired by Federal Agriculture Minister \uc2 David Littleproud\uc2  and attended by \uc2 the National Farmers' Federation\uc2 , state farming organisations, including AgForce, and banking representatives.\par \par \uc2 READ MORE: A poem for drought-stricken farmers\par \cell \pard \ql

I'm \uc2 Peter Warne\uc2 , Chairman of the Macquarie Group board. I will be chairing the meeting today, and I'm pleased to formally declare the meeting open. I hope you enjoyed our opening video, featuring some of the projects that our teams have delivered around the world for the benefit of our clients and our communities. I'll now introduce you to some of your directors and some of Macquarie's senior executives here with us today.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 On my right is our Chief Executive Officer, \uc2 Nicholas Moore\uc2 ; and the Group's Chief Financial Officer, \uc2 Alex Harvey\uc2 . Next to Alex, our nonexecutive directors \uc2 Gordon Cairns\uc2 , \uc2 Glenn Stevens\uc2 , \uc2 Patricia Cross\uc2  and Gary Banks. To my left is our Company Secretary, \uc2 Dennis Leong\uc2 ; and next to him our nonexecutive directors \uc2 Michael Hawker\uc2 , \uc2 Nicola Wakefield Evans\uc2 , \uc2 Michael Coleman\uc2  and \uc2 Diane Grady\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In addition, we have seated in the front row some of Macquarie's executive committee, including \uc2 Mary Reemst\uc2 , Macquarie Bank Limited Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer; Shemara Wikramanayake, Head of Macquarie Asset Management and our next CEO, as we announced this morning. I will speak more about that terrific news in a moment. \uc2 Garry Farrell\uc2  and Ben Brazil, coheads of the Corporate and Asset Finance Group; Greg Ward, Head of Banking and Financial Services; \uc2 Tim Bishop\uc2 , Head of \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2 ; \uc2 Patrick Upfold\uc2 , our Chief Risk Officer; and \uc2 Nicole Sorbara\uc2 , our Chief Operating Officer.\par \par \uc2 Consistent with previous years, there are 4 parts to today's meeting. First, I'll provide an overview of Macquarie's performance over the past financial year. Nicholas will then take you through our result in greater detail, provide an update on the Group's first quarter performance and discuss the outlook for the rest of the year.\par \par \uc2 Following this, we'll hear from the 2 directors seeking reelection today: \uc2 Gordon Cairns\uc2  and myself. And Director \uc2 Glenn Stevens\uc2  is seeking election for the first time. I will then formally open the polls. At that point, we will break for about 0.5 hours. During this time, you'll be able to meet with members of the board and senior management. We encourage you to take this opportunity, particularly if you're unable to stay for the formal business. There's a showcase in the room to my left if you'd like to learn more about Macquarie.\par \par \uc2 And we'll also be serving light refreshments during the break. We will then reconvene and discuss the formal items of business and take questions on all items at the same time. To give shareholders the opportunity to speak, we'll give preference to those who have not yet asked a question. I would like to remind you that recording devices, photographic equipment and mobile phones cannot be used during the meeting. However, the meeting is being webcast live on the \uc2 Macquarie Group\uc2  website, and you will also be able to view the recording of the meeting there this evening.\par \par \uc2 I was delighted to announce this morning that Shemara Wikramanayake has accepted the board's invitation to replace Nicholas as Managing Director and CEO of the Macquarie Group from November 2018. I'd like to pause here and place on record the board's appreciation for the remarkable role Nicholas has played in Macquarie's success over the past decade as CEO and for many years before that as a member of the management team.\par \par \uc2 In the great tradition of his 4 predecessors, Nicholas has tirelessly driven Macquarie forward, building teams and businesses and transforming us into the global diversified company we are today. Just as importantly, Nicholas has embodied our core principles of opportunity, accountability and integrity. And had the vision to invest in ideas that leave Macquarie with a significant legacy of momentum and market leading positions. That legacy now falls to Shemara to build on as our sixth CEO. As I said in my statement to the market this morning, in considering the transition from Nicholas, I was delighted to have a candidate of Shemara's caliber to take the group forward. Like Nicholas, Shemara has been with the company for more than 30 years, most recently as head of our largest business, Macquarie Asset Management. Shemara has lived and worked all around the world with Macquarie, founding some of our key businesses and offices. I'm confident that she has all the necessary qualities to lead Macquarie into our next era of success.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas will retire and step down from the \uc2 Macquarie Group\uc2  board effective November 30, 2018 shortly after delivering the Group's results for the first half of the current financial year and completing the usual investor roadshow alongside Shemara. We will hear more from both of them over the months ahead.\par \par \uc2 Turning to board and other management changes. We were delighted to announce the appointment of former Reserve Bank of Australia governor \uc2 Glenn Stevens\uc2  to the \uc2 Macquarie Group\uc2  board and the \uc2 Macquarie Bank\uc2  board as an independent director from the November 1, 2017. We'll hear from Glenn later this morning as he's seeking election.\par \par \uc2 Patricia Cross\uc2  will be retiring as a Director of the Macquarie Group Limited and Macquarie Bank Limited after 5 years on the board effective after today's AGMs. Mrs. Cross' extensive experience in international and financial banking as well as considerable experience as a company Director of financial and wealth management corporations has been invaluable to the board. The board thanks Patricia for her dedicated service and wishes her well for the future.\par \par \uc2 At the end of last year, Stephen Allen retired as Macquarie's Chief Risk Officer and head of the Risk Management Group and stepped down from Macquarie's executive committee. We thank Stephen for his considerable contribution over his 25 years of service with Macquarie. On January 1, 2018, Macquarie's Chief Financial Officer and head of the \uc2 Financial Management Group\uc2 , \uc2 Patrick Upfold\uc2 , succeeded Mr. Allen as our Chief Risk Officer and head of the Risk Management group. Patrick has been with Macquarie for more than 20 years and served as Macquarie's Chief Financial Officer for 6 years. Also on January 1, \uc2 Alex Harvey\uc2  succeeded Mr. Upfold as Chief Financial Officer and head of the Financial Management group and joined Macquarie's executive committee. Alex joined Macquarie in 1999 following the acquisition of \uc2 Bankers Trust Australia\uc2  and has been employed by the group for almost 20 years.\par \par \uc2 I'll now move to an overview of Macquarie's performance during the last financial year. We were pleased to report that Macquarie's businesses continued to grow with profit up 15% on the prior year, highlighting the strengths of our global platform, the diversity of our business mix, the ongoing ability to adapt to changing market conditions and client needs. Our annuity-style businesses, Macquarie Asset Management, Corporate and Asset Finance, and Banking and Financial Services, representing approximately 70% of the Group's performance, continue to perform well with a combined net profit contribution up 6% on the prior year. Our capital markets facing businesses, Commodities and Global Markets and \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2 , also performed well with combined net profit up 11% on the prior year. As we outlined at the full year results announcement, Macquarie reported a record operating income of $10.9 billion, up 5%, and a net profit after tax of $2.56 billion. Earnings per share were $7.58 compared with $6.58 per share in the prior year. Nicholas will take you through this performance in greater detail during his presentation.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders received a full year dividend per ordinary share of $5.25 per share, up from $4.70 per share in the prior year, both franked at 45%. 70% of our profit or about $1.6 billion was returned to shareholders in dividends in line with our policy to pay between 60% and 80% of profits to shareholders each year as dividends.\par \par \uc2 This chart behind me highlights Macquarie's strong history of profitability. Since Macquarie's establishment in 1969, we have achieved a profit in every year for 49 years. Our unbroken profitability is reflected in Macquarie's long-term shareholder returns of more than 5,000% since listing. There are a number of factors behind this long-term performance, including our ability to adapt our portfolio mix to changing market conditions, our proven risk management framework, which has protected Macquarie through a number of major market downturns, and our strong balance sheet and capital position. We measure our success by the outcomes we deliver for our clients, shareholders, staff and communities. We have significant expertise that -- in sectors that are changing the world, including infrastructure, energy and technology. So we take very seriously the responsibility that comes with managing infrastructure assets used by 100 million people every day. Retirement savings of people all over the world or a transaction that transforms our client's company. It gives us great pride that we can provide cleaner drinking water to 5 million Shenyang residents in China, that communities access power for the first time often through renewable energy, enable household waste to be converted to clean energy, provide more competition and drive innovation in Australian retail banking, or connect communities through physical infrastructure or technologically. These are just some examples of the wider impact of our work beyond the bottom line. Nicholas will expand on some of these during his presentation.\par \par \uc2 The cornerstone of our success is our long-standing culture based on our 3 core principles of opportunity, accountability and integrity. While we are in business to be profitable, it is the way we do business that really defines us. The board is committing to ensuring that Macquarie has a sound risk culture and believes that this drives good conduct. We place significant emphasis on embedding an appropriate risk culture and managing conduct risk within our overall risk management framework.\par \par \uc2 It is well entrenched across all parts of the organization. Staff are expected to adhere to our guiding principles in all their day-to-day behaviors, actions and business decisions. Managing risk is the responsibility of every individual and business at Macquarie. In addition, the Risk Management Group provides strong, independent oversight of all our business operations. We have comprehensive policies, procedures and controls in place to guide staff in decision making and to ensure that they adhere to standards we expect of them. There are also measures to address and deter noncompliance.\par \par \uc2 These protocols have been key to Macquarie's success and stability over many years. Over the year, there are 157 matters involving conduct and policy breaches, which resulted in formal consequences. Consequences included additional training, adjustments to performance-based remuneration, impact on promotion, formal warnings and, for some, termination. These matters were considered to be isolated incidents and not systemic. While our risk management approach has been largely consistent since inception, we continually monitor and enhance our risk culture and management of conduct risk. There are a number of risk culture and conduct related initiatives and achievements during the year. We refreshed the risk culture framework, which outlines the indicators used to assess the strengths and areas for development within our business of -- within a business or function. The risk culture assessment process was acknowledged as market-leading by an independent source. And we continue to embed conduct risk management across all businesses and renewed our focus on supervision by rolling out supervision standards across the -- and global online training to support people, managers and directors. Macquarie also established the Customer Advocate Office at the end of March 2017 as part of our commitment to our Australian retail and small business clients. This year, the integrity office celebrates its 20th year as independent point of conduct -- contact for staff to safely raise concerns about potential misconduct, unethical behavior or breaches of our code of conduct. The integrity office continues to drive strong awareness of what we stand for and our code of conduct. Over the year, the integrity office visited 30 offices around the world and presented to over 2,000 people globally. It led to initiatives to remind people to speak up and listen up, through group wide campaigns and tailored training modules. And Macquarie became a founding member of the Ethics Alliance, a new corporate community designed by the Ethics Center to help raise the standards of business ethics in Australia and around the world. Macquarie has a substantial and long-standing commitment to the renewable energy and clean technology sectors. We're committed to using our expertise in infrastructure, renewable energy, clean technology and environmental markets to support the transition of the community to a low carbon economy. Last year, Macquarie invested or arranged over $9.5 billion of investment into renewable energy projects and more than $20 billion since 2010. Consistent with our strong risk management focus, Macquarie considers climate change and future carbon constraints within [the our] existing risk framework. We continue to work -- we support the work of the task force on climate related financial disclosures in seeking more consistent and clear financial disclosure of climate related risks across sectors. In the current year, Macquarie will continue to evolve its own disclosures to align with all relevant task force recommendations, including the recommendation regarding a 2-degree Celsius scenario. During the year a Macquarie-led consortium acquired the U.K. Green Investment Bank for GBP 2.3 billion from the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2 , creating one of Europe's largest teams of green energy investment specialists. The rebranded Green Investment Group business has invested in 60% of the U.K.'s offshore wind generation capacity, more than 30 waste environments projects, and financed over 1.8 gigawatts of social -- of solar projects. It has also developed a market leading proprietary approach to green impact assessment. Work began on creating this approach and methodology with the creation of the U.K. Green Investment Bank in 2012. Since then, it has been applied to over 120 projects worth in excess of GBP 14 billion across green infrastructure sectors, including onshore and offshore wind, solar, waste to energy and energy efficiency. There are a number of recent highlights reflecting our commitment to the renewable energy sector. In June this year, Macquarie issued a GBP 2 billion loan facility, including a GBP 500 million facility to finance green projects, becoming the first financial institution globally to issue a green loan under the green loan principles issued in March 2018. We're also involved in the creation of large-scale solar powered generation assets in India and the development of onshore wind farms in Sweden. I'd now like to make some comments on the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission into misconduct in the banking superannuation and financial services industry has been underway since December last year. So far, the Royal Commission has held public hearings about consumer lending, financial advice, small and medium enterprise lending and the experiences of regional and remote communities. Further rounds of hearings on superannuation insurance and consideration of policy issues arising from the first 6 rounds have also been announced. In November 2018, there'll be a round of public hearings, which will focus on policy consideration arising from those first 6 rounds. CEOs from a number of organizations, including Macquarie, will be called to give evidence. Macquarie has responded to the commission's inquiries and will continue to respond appropriately. I'd now like to outline the work of the Macquarie Group Foundation in support of nonprofit organizations around the world. One of the oldest and largest corporate foundations in Australia, the Macquarie Group Foundation and Macquarie staff have together contributed more than $330 million since its establishment in 1985. In the year ending March 31, 2018, the Foundation and Macquarie staff globally contributed $28.3 million to more than 1,500 community organizations around the world. In addition, staff gave over 16,000 hours of their time as volunteers, fundraisers and pro bono advisers. Our CEO and senior management dedicate their time as chairmen, directors and advisers to a variety of nonprofit organizations. We are very proud of the commitment shown by all of Macquarie staff to the communities in which they live and work around the world. The foundation's latest annual review highlights some of the charities supported by Macquarie and its staff and is available on Macquarie's website. We also invite you to visit the foundation stand in the showcase room during the break or after the meeting. I'd like to conclude my remarks by sharing with you a tool available on our website at macquarie.com/discover. Here you can access the latest information about Macquarie, including our culture, expertise and case studies about the work our staff are doing around the world for the benefit of our clients and communities. You can also view these materials in the showcase room. That concludes my opening remarks. I'll now hand over to Nicholas to discuss Macquarie's results in more detail and update you on our recent performance. Thank you. Nicholas?\par \par \uc2 NICHOLAS WILLIAM MOORE\uc2 , CEO, GROUP MD & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED: Okay. Well thank you, Peter for your very kind comments and more importantly, for your and the board's leadership over the last 10 years. I'd also like to thank so many shareholders in this room and friends for their support for Macquarie over this period. It's wonderful to see so many familiar faces who've been with us for all that period, and in many cases, many years before. It's been a great joy and privilege for me to work at Macquarie for the last 32 years and to be the CEO for the last 10. Macquarie is a remarkable organization and over many years has evolved to a very successful global financial services group, with many leading market positions. And we'll talk about a lot of those today. Our embracing culture has continued to provide no shortages of new opportunities and challenges. A lot of my time as CEO has been spent testing new ideas and new opportunities with our team every day. Watching them realize these opportunities has been one of the most rewarding aspects of this job. It was never going to be easy to leave, but after some deliberation, I decided the time is now right after 10 years in the role. The firm is plainly in great shape with all businesses going well as we will see in today's presentations. They all have a strong potential to continue that trajectory under the leadership of each of our group heads. Perhaps more importantly, in Shemara, we have an outstanding successor. Her 30 year track record of success at Macquarie is a testament to her talent, her energy and her integrity. I've been fortunate to work with her closely throughout her time with the firm. Shemara embodies Macquarie's culture and our principles of opportunity, accountability and integrity. Her achievements range across many businesses local and international, and extends to her leadership of the foundation that Peter just spoke about. I have absolutely no doubt that Shemara will continue Macquarie's successful evolution and take Macquarie to new heights. I'll now review the full year results for 2018, in addition highlight the contribution of each of the group heads to the growth of those businesses over the last 10 years. I'll also provide an update for the first quarter result and provide an outlook for the rest of the year. Now turning to the results for the full year ended March 31, 2018. I'll bring that up on the screen. You can -- as you know it was a record result, up 15% on where we were in the prior year to $2,557,000,000. This slide shows where that contribution came from. You saw the net operating income was up 5%, given the operating leverage in the business, in other words, our revenue is greater than our cost, the operating profit before income tax was up a higher amount at 12%, and given our tax rate was slightly lower, the profit per shareholder was up 15%. Very pleasingly the annualized return on equity was 16.8% as you can see, up 11% on last year. Earnings per share as Peter mentioned up 15% to $7.58. And dividends per ordinary share at $5.25, up 12% on the prior year. The next slide shows where we generate our income globally. And as you know, we are a global firm and you can see about 1/3 of our income is derived here in Australia. More than -- almost half our people are based here in Australia, obviously, supporting the global operations. You can see in Europe, we derive about 29% of our income, in America, about 27% of our income, and in Asia, about 11% of our income. Again, a disproportionate number of staff in Asia, about 2,500 representing again the services provided for the global group. We've also added to this slide some of our activities in these countries and particularly asset management businesses. And so you can see the amount of assets we have in the different regions and we talk about the number of people we employ in those assets. So in the Americas, for example, we see the assets we manage at $255 billion. But we actually are employing about 29,000 people in these businesses. In Europe you can see the number is about $92 billion in terms of assets under management, employing about 40,000 people. And a similar number in Asia about 40,000 people being employed there, with $51 billion worth of assets. Now I would like to talk about the 5 different business groups that make up Macquarie. And as we've said before, you can't really understand Macquarie without actually addressing those 5 different business groups. Now we divide them broadly into 2 different categories. On the left hand side, you can see the annuity-style business is about 70% of the total and on the right hand side, the capital markets facing business is about 30% of the total. One of the interesting developments of that group over the last 10 years is how we've seen the annuity businesses grow basically about 30% of the total back 10 years ago. So we've seen strong growth come through over those last 10 years across all those different businesses and I'll talk about that in a minute. Now turning to our largest business, annuity-style business Macquarie Asset Management. This is a business that Shemara has been running now for 10 years and doing a wonderful job. You can see last year was a record result, $1.7 billion in terms of contribution, up 10% on where it was this time the year before. You can see assets under management also a record amount at $495 billion at March 31. I'll update you in terms of where they are in a second, at the end of the quarter, but they stepped up and again and stepped up very materially. So a very good result coming through from the 3 different divisions from MIRA, that's the infrastructure business, there you can see $86 billion of assets under management; MIM, that $333 billion; and MSIS, this is the smallest group there, but interesting in developing a whole range of new strategies, particularly highlight this infrastructure debt fund they've able to build, which is the leading product in the market globally. Now needless to say of course, the infrastructure asset management business, the equity side is the #1 business in the world and has continued to be. Over the last 10 years, under Shemara's leadership, we've seen great changes take place in this business. We've seen the assets under management double over that period and the profit effectively step up 5x. So very big step up in terms of performance coming through from that business. And even on the asset -- we say the assets have only doubled, we've seen a total renewal in terms of what's happening in the MIRA business. So those assets mature on an ongoing basis and get sold and we've not only been able to replace them but actually increase the numbers of assets that we are managing there, so a really remarkable performance. As Peter said, we've got this new tool available on our website called Discover Macquarie and these are some of the examples of some of the projects we talk about around the world with respect to the asset management business. As Peter mentioned, we're providing services to over 100 million people every day, essential services. And as Peter mentioned, it would include things like providing out water to the city of Shenyang, 5 million people every day. Of course we've had other water companies and continue to have other water companies, such as \uc2 Thames Water\uc2  providing water to people in London. As well as Asia you can see on the slide, and you saw on the video earlier, actually delivering new assets. Not just running existing assets but building new assets. So the Goethals Bridge transaction that we highlighted in the video really interesting in terms of how we're stepping up and improving the infrastructure. In terms of how we run the infrastructure, obviously, we're proud of running it well. And we highlight there with \uc2 Thames Water\uc2 , we reduced leakage rates in that system by 22% during our period of ownership. We also highlight that with the Indian tollways that we actually manage there, we've been able to deliver 26 million hours without injury in terms of that business. Now, that business needless to say proud of us stepping up and taking over, the record wasn't as successful as that. So lots of contribution we're making to communities all around the world. And as we said it's all on the Discover Macquarie website.\par \par \uc2 Now turning to our Corporate and Asset Finance business a record result coming through here at $1.2 billion. Two broad groups within the Corporate and Asset Finance, we have our leasing business. Our leasing business, which is about $30 billion worth of assets and you can see some of them listed here, motor vehicles in Australia, aircraft worldwide. You can see we have almost 200 aircraft worldwide. And as well as our specialized assets such as meters in the U.K. So good performance coming through from the business, a record performance. It's also a great to reflect on where that business was 10 years ago. 10 years ago it wasn't even making $100 million so the team have been able to step it up dramatically over that period. Gary has been running the asset financing business and we've seen rapid growth in that business as we been able to step up, and not just organically grow those portfolios, but also step up and buy portfolios, and buy businesses and expand them over the world. So we've seen both organic growth and the ability to step up and buy things. As well as that Ben Brazil has been able to build this new business for us in terms of Principal Finance. And as you can see on that slide, over the period, we've been running this business, we've had $37 billion worth of transactions. Transactions we've been able to go and secure and then actually realize over the period. So at the moment the book's about $5 billion, but that understates the activity actually taking place in that business and the success of that business over the period. So a remarkable Macquarie story in terms of what's been able to be achieved. In terms of the contribution to the community, again this is on our Discover Macquarie. And you can sort of see a couple of things coming through here that are interesting and interesting for the whole group. One of which is this renewable theme. So you can see in terms of the assets that we're financing includes things like smart meters in the U.K. and also rooftop solar here in Australia and also in the U.K. As well as then, of course, the change taking place in the world through technology. We're very much embracing that across all our businesses. You can see the team in CAF is doing that as well. You can see it in terms of our car leasing business; big changes taking place in terms of how people are buying cars. MotoMe is a product we're developing allowing people to actually step up and buy a car very quickly online, choose a car, buy it, finance it, all doing it within a very short period of time as you can see. And as well as that, smartphones. We all are using smartphones. For the last 10 years, obviously, one of the revolutions that have taken place in our lives is smartphones. Again CAF is stepping up and embracing smartphones. We are providing leases to major telecoms here in Australia and elsewhere in the world. And actually looking at very innovative uses in terms of what happens to those phones at the end of their life. So a lot's happening in the business and a lot's happened all over the world. Now turning to banking and financial services, again a record result for this business. Last year $560 million, up 9% on the year ahead. That step up of 9% actually understates what took place there. The step up was actually greater because last year, we had the sale of our life business, which is one off profit. So the underlying growth in the business was actually more substantial. You can see that business continue to grow over the period. You can see deposits step up 3%. The funds on the platform, this is our WRAP platform, stepped up 14%, and the mortgage portfolio stepped up 14% over the period as well. Now that growth in those businesses obviously provide profitability not just in the year, and indeed most of that profitability will come in years to come. We're servicing about 1 million customers in that business. Again this is a story of a great Macquarie story in terms of role that the team has played, led by Greg, particularly over the last 5 years in terms of transforming and growing that business. Greg used to be our CFO until 5 years ago. We asked him to step up and take on this business and he's done a wonderful job in terms of transforming it. Obviously, there's no shortage of challenges in retail financial services today. We've actually gotten very much on top of those challenges and actually doubled the profit over that period as well. And we've doubled it in terms of attending to the basic needs of the clients and actually investing very heavily in technology to be providing great services for our customers. In terms of our impact on the community, in terms of this banking financial services business, it is a lot greater than you'd think. It's only 2% of most product categories we're in. So 2% of mortgages, less than 2% of credit cards, relatively small market share. But if you look at our history, what we've been able to do in retail financial services really has had a much bigger impact. If we go all the way back to the 80s, people might remember the Hill Samuel and then Macquarie Cash Management Trust. That was the first time that retail investors could actually benefit from higher deposit rates offered between the banks. Then the '90s we were able to -- so in the '80s we were able to increase deposit rates. In the '90s we were able to actually look at mortgage prices by using wholesale securitization to deliver mortgage pricing at lower cost in terms of our [alpuna] business. And at the moment, of course, we're embracing technology, a whole range of different examples here, including open banking, which we think that will allow competition to come in. Now technology is changing how banking is done. You don't now ever need branches, and obviously as an organization like ours with a lot of technology a lot of skills we're providing leading digital product, and Greg is very much at the forefront of rolling that out across the country.\par \par \uc2 Now turning to our capital markets facing businesses. Our commodities and global markets business had a good year, looking at the result there, $910 million, it's down 6%, that's really accountable (sic) [attributable] to a slight accounting treatment. We basically as a result of deferral of income, the profit -- the underlying nonprofit was greater than that, but still a very strong result coming through. Strong result coming through from a whole range of businesses delivering in markets all over the globe as you can see there. In terms of the growth of this business over the last 10 years, it has been remarkable. Obviously, the last 10 years has seen a lot of volatility in the financial markets. We've been profitable, not just in Macquarie over that period, but in our Commodities and Global Markets business. We have been profitable in every year over the last 10 years in this business, which is remarkable. Not only being profitable, but we've been able to grow those businesses. One of the businesses we highlight here that's grown under Andrew's leadership over that 10-year period is our energy business. You can see we only started it 10 years ago. We are now the second largest player in the U.S. gas market. So one of the largest global energy markets in the world and our team has been able to grow to its second largest position. More recently, we've actually incorporated the securities business into this business, that's also going well. Last year, we saw it being profitable and it continues to be profitable as well. So a great story for Andrew who has been leading that team, not just for the last 10 years, but for many years before that. In terms of the contribution to the community, again going back to Discover Macquarie, we talked about some of the things we're doing, adding competition in the North American market as a result of the acquisition of this Cargill energy business. Renewables, again that theme coming through across Macquarie in terms of developing renewable power stations in the U.K. And finally technology, another one of the things we've talked about before, and providing the ability for people to invest in Chinese technology companies. So very interesting stories taking place there. Now, finally coming to our last business and the business actually had the biggest step up in terms of profitability, \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2 . So $700 million profit contribution last year, up 45% on where it was the year before. So the largest single contribution to the step up in our result last year. So really strong performance, strong performance coming through from the traditional areas that you'd expect from Macquarie in terms of our #1 M&A position here in the Australian market, as well as our #1 position in the infrastructure market. But what we've seen happen in this business in recent years, of course, is great growth taking place under Tim's leadership. Tim's been leading the business for 6 years after he developed our U.S. business, and it's really pleasing to see that the biggest contributor to fees last year for this business was coming out of the U.S. in terms of our DCM, ACM, and M&A fees. So that's now surpassing what we've actually had here in Australia. Big tribute to Tim in terms of growing that U.S. business. More recently, of course, what we're seeing driving the business and Tim driving the business is delivering these renewable assets, renewable developments here in Australia, in Asia in the United States and Europe. And in Europe obviously, very notable last year with the acquisition of the Green Investment Bank. So this a bank that had been set up by the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  to encourage investment in green energy and other renewable projects. The government decided to sell it and we were able to step up and we've been entrusted in terms of taking that business on, which effectively doubles our business in Europe in this sort of activity. So real global leadership in renewables as well as infrastructure, which is a great tribute to Tim and the team.\par \par \uc2 In terms of \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2 's contribution to communities around the world, lots of features here you'd expect to see, including that renewable story I just mentioned, as well as that's a broader energy story. So we highlight here the development of a power station in Mexico. This power station had been developed and it actually failed from a financial viewpoint. Our people could step in actually, provide the financing and actually allow that project to complete, which is a great success. So we're seeing renewable energy, we're seeing traditional energy in the United States. We're also seeing it here in Australia with Quadrant Energy. And of course in technology. That theme coming through again in the Macquarie results. We highlight here the investment in PEXA. You probably know that Macquarie was very early investors and helped in the development of Australian companies, such as Seek and realestate.com in the technology space. We're doing the same thing in PEXA which is a way of allowing people to buy and sell houses and allow the conveyancing to take place in an electronic way. We own 25% of this company, you will have seen some press about it, and it's part of the ongoing \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2  business in looking at great technology companies. Now turning to the group. Now obviously these 5 businesses are supported by the group, and this is a slide you would see before, updated with the numbers for 31 March in terms of how we look at the support for the group from a financial viewpoint. Left hand side is how we fund our balance sheet, and of course, we are very conservative. So even though we are a financial services organization we ensure that all our term assets are actually financed by term liabilities. So our term liabilities and our equity extend the term assets, so we can never be in a position where we have a shortfall of funding. As well as that, of course, we are very conservative in our capital settings, and you can see there our capital surpluses at 31 March was $4.2 billion. And then we talk about our ratings. Our ratings for 27 years, of \uc2 Standard & Poor's\uc2  maintained at A rating. This is a great tribute, of course, to our finance team, to Alex who's heading it at the moment. But before that, of course, Patrick led that for 5 years, \uc2 Patrick Upfold\uc2 , our head of R&D, as you heard about earlier, and prior to that as I mentioned, Greg Ward. Stuart Green, our treasurer who is in the audience today, has also been very focused in terms of ensuring that this is well-managed and well-maintained over the period. As Peter mentioned, risk has always been at the heart of Macquarie. We very much attribute that 49 years of profitability to our risk culture in the organization. And the center point of owning that risk culture is RMG, our Risk Management Group that \uc2 Patrick Upfold\uc2  has been heading up for the last 12 months after stepping down from being the CFO, and that continues to do very well indeed. Part of Risk, of course, is Legal, and we've got a very strong legal team headed by Michael Herring, who is looking at all our risks and all our documentation and ensuring that we minimize the risk that we take in our business. And finally, of course, all of this is supported by our core group, our operations group that's headed by Nicole Sobrara. I've been fortunate to work with Nicole now for more than 20 years. And she is doing an absolutely excellent job in terms of supporting all elements of the group, from the physical locations we carry on business, to every trade that gets concluded every day, to the technology spend that we're talking about across the group. I'd also like to mention Mary who sat in the front row who is the CFO of Macquarie Bank Limited. \uc2 Macquarie Bank Limited\uc2  makes up more than half of the profitability of the group in the most recent result, a very critical role and as Peter mentioned, always important in terms of an organization like ours. Now turning to an update for the first quarter result. As you can see here on the slide, operating groups are performing in line with expectations. Our first quarter operating group contribution, and importantly this is based on management accounts, not financial accounts, because we only prepare financial accounts twice a year. But based on management accounts, our result is up on the prior corresponding period this time last year, but it's down on the strong prior quarter.\par \par \uc2 Now the prior quarter, of course, is the 31 March quarter, which is always a particularly strong quarter from a \uc2 Macquarie Group\uc2  viewpoint. In terms of the 2 different groups of businesses I talked about before, the annuity-style businesses continue to perform well, a continued strong base in performance fees in MAM, and I'll talk about that in a second. CAF as I mentioned before, the principal portfolio is down on pcp, but the profitability of that business will be largely determined on the timing of the realizations of the business. In terms of BFS, we continue to see the trends we've seen in recent years with the growth taking place in mortgages, business banking and the underlying platforms. Deposits are in line with where we were in the pcp. The capital markets facing businesses as you'd expect are experiencing strong trading conditions across most of our markets. Strong activities in Commodities and Global Markets, particularly in the commodity markets and the fixed income products. \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2 's balance sheet positions are performing in line with expectations and solid realizations were achieved during the quarter. Fee revenue from DCM is down on a very strong prior corresponding period. There were no significant one-off items during the period. Now turning to a bit more detail in terms of what's happening in the businesses, a little bit more of a highlight. Turning to Macquarie Asset Management. You can see very pleasingly, the assets under management were up 8% over the quarter, 8% big step up to the $534 billion. Real highlight of that is MIRA; equity under management up 18%. Now as you know, this is one of our most important businesses, so seeing that step up in assets under management is very, very significant, to over $100 billion, $102 billion. So it's good, the driver for that part is the acquisition as we mentioned here, of the GLL Real Estate platform, a business based in Germany, but as well as that it's from the -- a whole range of commitments coming through that we mentioned here and in the investment of almost $5 billion worth of equity over the period. So a strong performance coming through from MIRA and you saw also we note the significant highlights from MIM and MSIS. From a CAF viewpoint, the portfolio is broadly in line with where it's been. It's performing in line with expectations and we note here, new transactions taking place in the Principal Finance business. Banking and Financial Services, those metrics continue to roll on in a manner that we've seen before. So the mortgage portfolio, up 5% on the quarter, strong growth there. Funds on the platform again, up 5%. Business banking loan portfolio and BFS deposits, up 3% on where we were and we also note a number of awards we've won there.\par \par \uc2 Capital markets facing businesses, we note there the strong market conditions and we're seeing increased client hedging and trading opportunities across the commodities platform and particularly in that North American Gas, that business I mentioned before, where we have a #2 market position. Continued strong customer activity in foreign exchange and futures as well. Strong underwriting income from cash equities particularly in Asia, and maintaining our #2 ranking as I mentioned before in North American GAS. \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2  as you can see, they've been very active, 115 deals completed -- I see another one announced this morning, team -- to the value of $160 billion, up on pcp and on the prior period. Fee revenue from ECM and M&A broadly in line with pcp. And as I mentioned before, DCM income, slightly down on that very strong pcp we had before. Strong market position being maintained here in Australia for M&A and global renewables, so very interesting. Turning to the balance sheet, not much changed in the balance sheet from March 31 to June 30. As you can see here, growing slightly but nothing significant happening. In terms of our capital position, we obviously had a very strong surplus as of March 31. You can see here $6.3 billion capital services surplus on a harmonized basis. 4.2% on an APRA equivalent basis. We highlighted that, that surplus was going to reduce with the payment of dividends in the MEREP and you can see that took place, the $1.5 billion reducing it. Pleasingly, the team raised $1 billion in terms of the hybrid issue, which more than offset the repayment of the $600 million worth of hybrid, and then you can see earnings and other factors, meaning that our harmonized surplus position at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion. Adjusting for the APRA super equivalence reduces our surplus to $3.4 billion, a strong position as of the end of the quarter. In terms of other regulatory ratios, all strong as you can see. What we've done here, the dotted line is what our regulatory minimum is, and then we put in where we set our base both on a harmonized basis, a globally harmonized basis, and on an APRA basis. So when we look at the CET ratio, that's a capital ratio, our requirement as you can see here is 7%. We're at 10.3% on an APRA viewpoint and 12.8% on a harmonized viewpoint. Our leverage ratio, 3% is the requirement at the moment. We're at 5.6% on an APRA basis, 6.4% on a harmonized basis. LCR 155% compared with the requirement of 100% and NSFR, 112% compared with the requirement of 100%. So all very strong regulatory ratios as you would expect.\par \par \uc2 Now turning to regulatory and tax matters. A bit of an update in terms of what's happening here. Turning to regulatory capital, you will all recall the David Murray financial review and the government's response to it, in terms of Australian banks having to be unquestionably strong. APRA's issued a paper on it and said across the industry it'd expect 100 -- expect a step up requirement of 150 basis points. More work is going on, on that. At the moment, obviously, with our surplus capital position, we feel comfortable we should accommodate whatever the final outcome of that will be. A new thing coming through in terms of the related entities framework from APRA, they've issued a discussion paper there, which we're working with them on at the moment. At the moment we think it could result in some subtle changes to the group, but we don't expect to see any material impact on our results. As well as that I forgot to mention on the way through the proposed change in the leverage ratio with the minimum requirement now of 4% from July 19. Obviously, in terms of where we sit, we can accommodate that rule. Our U.S. tax reform. I think we're all aware that the tax rates in the U.S. have been dropped, and as you saw a substantial amount of our income is derived in the U.S. As a result of that, we expect our effective tax rate to fall by about 3% to 4% over historic levels. We also note recent press articles about \uc2 Macquarie Bank Limited\uc2 , sorry, recent press articles about Germany and a review being taken by German authorities concerning dividend trading between the years of 2006 and 2012, and \uc2 Macquarie Bank Limited\uc2  are being mentioned in these articles. We previously provided for these matters and continue to assist the German authorities with their investigation of these matters. Now capital management, we obviously, we have the buyback in place, but no buyback -- no capital buyback took place during the period. In terms of our -- what will result in us stepping up for the capital buyback will depend upon our capital surplus position, market conditions at the time and of course, most importantly, opportunities to deploy capital by the business. We've got a very strong message from shareholders, they'd much prefer us to use the capital in the business rather than a buyback, so we are constantly looking at opportunities to deploy that capital. As I mentioned earlier, we completed a $1 billion hybrid issue over the quarter.\par \par \uc2 Now I'd like to turn to the outlook for the full year, and the outlook really hasn't changed on where it was at the full year. What we do in terms of our short-term outlook, we talk about all the different businesses and we highlight some of the factors that may impact a change in the result this year versus last year. And so you can go around the different slides and you can see some of the elements I've talked about before. So from a MAM viewpoint, we're talking about base fees being higher. At the moment, we expect performance fees will probably be lower than the very strong level that we had last year.\par \par \uc2 From a CAF viewpoint, we note that the book is largely unchanged in terms of size, but the underlying profitability will be determined by the realizations that happen on the principal book, and the timing of those, of course, is uncertain.\par \par \uc2 Banking and Financial Services, we talk about the underlying growth taking place in those businesses, continue to take place in those businesses, but we also do note, though, that in the retail financial services space in Australia, NIM is under pressure, and NIM being net interest margin, is under pressure.\par \par \uc2 In terms of the capital markets-facing businesses, we talk about the strong customer bases expected to drive consistent flow and improve result in Equity, which obviously, we're seeing in that first quarter.\par \par \uc2 From a \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2  viewpoint, we're assuming market conditions will be consistent with prior years and we also note, though, the solid pipeline of realizations that have been expected. From an overall corporate viewpoint, we note the fall in tax rate coming as a result of the changes in the United States. So bringing all that together, we haven't changed our outlook for the full year, and that we currently expect it to be broadly in line with the full year '18.\par \par \uc2 Now that outlook, of course, is subject to the factors that we can't control, including market conditions, the impact of foreign exchange, potential regulatory changes and tax uncertainty and the geographic composition of our income.\par \par \uc2 From a medium-term viewpoint, you've seen the slide before, I've been using this slide I think now for 7 years, it's unchanged. It's reflecting our confidence in the underlying business, confidence based upon the deep expertise that we have across our different businesses. We've seen it, obviously, over the last 10 years coming through very strongly in the annuity businesses. We've seen it in, more recently in the capital markets-facing businesses, are responding to the better market conditions as well as that we're very diligent in terms of costs. And as I mentioned, this is all underpinned by a very strong balance sheet, very conservative settings and a proven risk management framework. So as I said, it's unchanged over 7 years in terms of the slides that we're using, but perhaps more importantly, it's reflecting the character of Macquarie that's been here for about 49 years. My 4 predecessors very much developed a culture of the organization, this conservative focus that we have and very much an expertise, bottom-up-driven culture that has driven the business so successfully to where we are today.\par \par \uc2 Our next slide is where we have the capital in the business. You can see the annuity businesses are using about $9 billion worth of capital. The capital markets-facing businesses using about $6 billion worth of capital. And then we have the surplus capital on the slide there of about $4.2 billion, resulting in a surplus of -- sorry, resulting in a total amount of capital of about $19 billion. And the next slide is just talking about the different businesses in terms of their medium-term outlook. And with that, I'll hand back to Peter. Thank you very much for your attention. And as I said, thank you very much for your support, so many of you, for 10 years in my term as the CEO. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you, Nicholas. We now move to the formal items of business for the meeting. The notice of meeting and the accompanying explanatory notes have been circulated to shareholders, and I propose to take them as read.\par \par \uc2 The items of business are shown on the screens behind me. Item 1 on the agenda is to consider and receive the annual accounts. I now lay before the meeting the financial report, the directors' report and the auditor's report of the group for the year ended 31 March, 2018. Please note, there is no formal resolution relating to the financial statements.\par \par \uc2 Agenda Items 2a and 2b are for my and \uc2 Gordon Cairns\uc2 ' reelections as voting directors. Agenda Item 2c is the election of \uc2 Glenn Stevens\uc2  as a voting director.\par \par \uc2 Agenda Item 3 is the nonbinding vote on the remuneration report. The remuneration report is set out on Pages 50 through 82 of our 2018 annual report. There is a summary of the key elements in the explanatory notes to the Notice of Meeting. Our remuneration framework is long-standing and it has been a key to the success of Macquarie due to the alignment of the interest of our staff with that of our shareholders. There were no changes to our remuneration framework or its application in the 2018 financial year. Following requests last year from some of our shareholders and our advisers for some additional disclosures in our remuneration report, we undertook extensive engagement through the year with a range of our shareholders and our advisers to see what, if any, additional information they would like to see. You will have seen that we have increased our level of disclosure in 3 key areas in this year's remuneration report to incorporate the feedback we received. Firstly, awarded profit share, which illustrates how profit share awarded for the year is aligned with the current year's performance. Secondly, allocation of profit share. We have included further information on how profit share is determined and how it's allocated. And thirdly, consequence management. We have described our robust consequence management process, how it works and how it informs the board decision-making, including remuneration outcomes, for the financial year 2018. Overall, we have consistently received positive feedback about our approach to remuneration and our framework has successfully delivered superior performance while prudently managing risk.\par \par \uc2 Agenda Item 4 is to approve the managing director's participation in the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan, or MEREP, as we call it.\par \par \uc2 And the final item seeks to approve the issue in June of this year of Macquarie Group Capital Notes 3. The details of that issue are set out in the notice of meeting.\par \par \uc2 I now ask the board members who are seeking reelection today to speak. As I am the first director of the director elections on the agenda, I shall now ask \uc2 Michael Hawker\uc2  to take the chair for that agenda item. Michael?\par \par \uc2 MICHAEL JOHN HAWKER\uc2 , INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED: Thank you very much, Peter. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Agenda Item 2a is the reelection of \uc2 Peter Warne\uc2 , who has been Chairman of both the group and bank boards since April 2016. He has been an independent voting director of Macquarie since 2007. In addition to chairing the board, Peter is chairman of the board nominating committee, a member of the board remuneration committee and a member of the board risk committee. Peter has been a very valuable and insightful member of the board. We have greatly benefited from his extensive knowledge and experience in financial markets. Further, he has proven to be a very capable and collegiate (sic) [collegial] Chairman since his appointment. The board has determined that Peter remains independent and that his length of tenure has not affected his exercise of independent judgment to provide an objective assessment of matters considered by the board. I can assure shareholders that Peter demonstrates his independence during all board deliberations. The board unanimously supports Peter's ongoing leadership and reelection to the Macquarie board. I have now the pleasure of calling upon Peter to speak briefly to his reelection. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you, Mike. I appreciate the opportunity to address shareholders in connection with my reelection as a director of Macquarie. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I bring valuable and wide-ranging skills to the Macquarie board. I have extensive knowledge of and experience in investment banking, particularly capital markets, financial markets and dealing rooms and can contribute strongly to the board in technical discussions. I have also a highly developed understanding of the operations of commercial enterprise, and my tenure as a director of the Sydney Futures Exchange and the \uc2 ASX\uc2  has armed me with significant exposure to the regulatory requirements of listed companies and financial markets. I spent most of my early career in banking at \uc2 Bankers Trust Australia\uc2 , where for 12 years, I was responsible for the financial markets group, which is similar to Macquarie's Commodity and Global Markets group. My day-to-day role involved oversight of all elements of the various businesses, including risk, capital and liquidity positions and -- being held by the bank and the activities of trading staff. I was also a member of the Bankers Trust management committee for the same period, in addition to several of the group's global committees. After many years on the Macquarie board, I have a deep understanding of the company's operations in Australia and globally. My role as a member of both the board remuneration and board risk committees has reinforced to me the importance of Macquarie's approach to remuneration and its contribution to Macquarie's success while prudently managing risk. In my current role as a professional non-executive director, I'm also a director of the ASX Limited New South Wales Treasury Corporation and a member of the \uc2 Macquarie University\uc2  Faculty of Business and Economics Industry Advisory Board. I've served Macquarie as Chairman since 2016 and believe I have the relevant skills and experience to continue to be an effective Chairman if I'm reelected today. I can confirm to my fellow board members that I have and will continue to have sufficient time to properly fulfill my duties as Chairman of the board. I regard it as a privilege to serve as Chairman of this outstanding Australian company, and if reelected, will continue to work with the board and management on behalf of all our stakeholders, especially you, our shareholders. Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 Now Agenda Item 2b is the reelection of \uc2 Gordon Cairns\uc2 . Gordon has been a director of Macquarie since November 2014. He currently serves on the board nominating committee and the remuneration and risk committees. Gordon has brought a depth and breadth of knowledge developed during a diverse and distinguished business career. The Macquarie board has benefited greatly from his financial, marketing and operational experience as well as his considerable global senior executive management and listed-company board experience. In particular, we have benefited from his deep insight into retail customers and energy markets, which are both important parts of Macquarie's businesses. I have pleasure in calling on Gordon to say a few words in support of his reelection as a director. Gordon?\par \par \uc2 GORDON MCKELLAR CAIRNS, INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED: Thank you, Peter. Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to offer myself for reelection to the board. For those of you who don't know me, let me outline modestly my credentials. I've got extensive public company experience, having served on the board of \uc2 Lion Nathan\uc2  as Chief Executive for 7 years, on the \uc2 Westpac\uc2  board for 9 years as a non-executive director and as the Chairman of David Jones for 3 months and the Rebel Group. I am currently the Chairman of Woolworths Group and Origin Energy. Yes, it's been over 40 years in the consumer goods and retail sectors and this has given me not only scar tissue, but a deep understanding of business from a customer perspective, which I have utilized to the benefit of the Macquarie board. I have also gained strong expertise in the energy sector, which is beneficial to Macquarie given our increasing interest in that area. I have broad international experience, having worked in Europe, United States, China and Australasia, with a number of global companies and 16 houses. Finally, I confirm that I have the time, the energy and the enthusiasm to fulfill my duties as a director of Macquarie. And if reelected, I promise to serve you diligently and dutifully. Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you, Gordon. Agenda Item 2c is the election of \uc2 Glenn Stevens\uc2 , who having been appointed to the board as an independent voting director effective 1 November, 2017, offers himself for reelection. Glenn worked at the highest levels of the \uc2 Reserve Bank of Australia\uc2  for 20 years, culminating in the role of Governor of the Reserve Bank from 2006 to 2016. He has extensive experience in global economics and is an internationally respected central banker who brings a unique perspective to our boards, not only regarding the drivers of the Australia's economy, but also those of international economies from which Macquarie derives the majority of its income. He has added significant banking and financial knowledge to the Macquarie board. Since the appointment to the board, Glenn has been a member of the board nominating and risk committees. He was also recently appointed as a member of the board audit committee. I have pleasure in calling on Glenn to say a few words in support of his election as a director. Glenn?\par \par \uc2 GLENN R. STEVENS\uc2 , INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MACQUARIE BANK LIMITED: Thank you, Chairman, and good morning, fellow shareholders. Thank you for considering my election. Since my appointment to the board in November last year, I've greatly enjoyed learning about the organization's very diverse business activities. I've been incredibly impressed with the caliber of people here and its culture and I've enjoyed contributing to the board's work. My background is as a professional economist. I was a career central banker, 36 years, life sentence, including, as Peter said, 20 years at the most senior levels, 15 years as a board member and 10 years as Governor and Chairman of the Board. Those roles gave me experience in running a professional financial organization with a significant balance sheet, about the same size as Macquarie's, in fact. They also gave me extensive exposure to the global economic and financial forces which are so key to Macquarie's businesses around the world. My share of scar tissue and access and working with the key policymakers at the global level. I worked extensively with local and international peers, representing Australia on the international \uc2 Financial Stability Board\uc2 , including chairing one of its committees on the G20. And I chaired the Australian Council of Financial Regulators. In my current life, I maintain my close interest in international economic and financial events. I'm a board member of the \uc2 Lowy Institute\uc2 , and I recently accepted an appointment as chair of the advisory board of the New South Wales sovereign wealth fund. I believe that my public policy, regulatory, financial and economic background in Australia and internationally complements the skill sets of the other members of the board, and that I can add value to the board's oversight of Macquarie's global operations. If elected, I can assure you I do have and will give the necessary time and commitment needed to discharge fully my responsibilities to the company and to you as shareholders. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you, Glenn. To allow everyone attending today an opportunity to vote, I will now open the polls in respect of all motions that shareholders will vote on today. If you have either a pink shareholder or a green proxyholder card, you can vote by filling in the back of the card and placing it in one of the ballot boxes. Please keep your voting card until the end of the meeting or until you leave the meeting. You will need to show your voting card if you leave and plan to reenter the meeting room. Representatives from our registry are available to provide assistance to you if you have any questions about how to vote. I now adjourn the meeting to allow shareholders the opportunity to meet with the board and members of the senior management team before providing you with the opportunity to discuss the management of the company and the items of business. I also invite you to explore the Macquarie showcase in the adjacent room and learn more about Macquarie. As I said earlier, refreshments will be served now instead of after the meeting. We will reconvene in about 1/2 an hour, which I believe will be about 12:15. Thank you very much.\par \par \uc2 (Break)\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you had an opportunity to speak with members of the board and management. I now reconvene the meeting. Now just before we get on with the formal business, I had a few shareholders speak to me during the break, asking that they'd like to hear from Shemara. We hadn't had a spot for her on the formalities today, but Shemara would be very happy to say a few words and introduce herself. So she's got a microphone and if she can stand and tell you all a bit about herself.\par \par \uc2 SHEMARA WIKRAMANAYAKE, HEAD OF MACQUARIE ASSET MANAGEMENT, \uc2 MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED\uc2 : Thanks very much, Peter, and thanks to those of you who asked to hear from me. So I've been at Macquarie for 30 years, much of Nicholas's time. And as Peter and Nicholas have mentioned, I've worked all over the world in a lot of countries and a lot of different businesses for that time. I did want to say, first of all, that I want to acknowledge the contribution that Nicholas has made in the last 32 years here, not just in what he's delivered over that 32 years as you've seen in his record results he's just talked about and nearly a 17% return on equity in a world where you all know getting returns like that is not easy. That is an amazing legacy. But on top of that, it's really the way he's handling the step-down and hand-over. He's going, and people ask me, "Why is Nicholas going, what's wrong, blah, blah," he's going because nothing is wrong and he's very comfortable that there is great momentum in this business that he has given 32 years to developing for all of you and delivering results in. And he's comfortable that not just myself, but this leadership team, my colleagues sitting here in the front row and the 14,500 people behind us, have great momentum and are going to keep delivering. And as you saw in that inspiring video at the beginning, that's really what makes our business, is all those people all over the world in different communities, business lines, coming up with phenomenal ideas, spotting opportunities, being accountable for disciplined execution and as Nicholas described it, the bottom-up culture of delivering results. So for my part, I'm really excited to get this opportunity to play this role. As Nicholas said, I've worked in a lot of businesses and been deep in the asset management for the last 10 years. I'm really excited and challenged about learning about the other businesses that I actually haven't been involved in and are being run phenomenally by my colleagues and hearing from them and our teams around the world where they see greatest opportunity and how we can grow things. But for the short term, Nicholas, who's been a friend, a colleague, a mentor, a boss for 30 years, he's going to be working closely with me for the next 4 months, thank goodness, very generously, making sure that I absorb the knowledge that he has developed in his tenure as the CEO and his understanding that you heard of as he spoke deeply of all of these other business lines and we think about how we position things to take things forward for all of you and continue the momentum that we've delivered. For those of you, some of you I know who told me you've been shareholders since listing 22 years ago. We're hoping to continue to deliver for you. So thank you all for giving me the opportunity and I'm a bit nervous about it, but look forward to being up on that stage in Nicholas's seat next year and talking to you about the results we've delivered for you.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you very much, Shem. Now, it is -- I just need to remind you all that the polls do remain open and that you can vote at any time. If you need to leave the meeting before it's complete, please deliver your voting cards to the monitors on your way out the door. It's my duty as Chairman to ensure that all shareholders as a whole have a reasonable opportunity to ask questions about or make comments on the management of the company, the remuneration report and other items of business before the meeting today. I'm committed to ensuring that people in this room feel safe and respected at all times. This includes ensuring that the discussion is about matters of interest to shareholders as a group. To achieve this, I have adopted the procedures for this meeting as set out on the slide behind me. Questions and comments should be concise and limited to 2 questions at a time. If you have individual customer issues or matters that don't relate to the items of business at today's meeting, please raise them with our staff in the foyer during or immediately after the meeting.\par \par \uc2 I also note that Mr. Kim Smith from \uc2 PricewaterhouseCoopers\uc2 , the group's auditor, is present at today's meeting. He's available to respond to any questions relevant to the conduct of the audit, the preparation and content of the auditor's report, the accounting policies adopted by the company in relation to the preparation of the financial statements and the independence of the auditor in relation to the conduct of the audit. The auditor did not receive any written questions from shareholders prior to the meeting. If you wish to address the meeting, please proceed to one of the standing microphones, there's 3 of them, I believe, in the room and provide your name and voting card to the microphone and attendant. Please note that only persons holding pink, green or blue attendance cards are entitled to address the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Now would any member like to address the meeting regarding any items of business, the management of the group or about the audit?\par \par \uc2 Questions and Answers\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce [Peter Sainsbury], register number 1-0-1-8, to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Welcome, Peter.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Chair. I have 1 general question and then 1 question relating to your seeking reelection.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Certainly.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Do you want me to ask them together or...?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Yes, fire away.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: My first question is do climate change-related matters impact on our directors' and officers' insurances? So for instance, coverage exclusions and occurrences, disclosures, notification of considerations and so on? So it's a question about whether climate change issues affect those insurances that the individual share -- the individual directors hold.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Let's follow with the second question.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: The second question relates to your reelection, Mr. Chair. And last year, when asked if our company would implement the recommendations of the \uc2 Financial Stability Board\uc2 's Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures, you admitted you didn't know what this global benchmark requirement, this disclosure, was. Now this appears inconsistent with statements made earlier in 2017 by APRA, which described climate risk as an emerging issue [this] financial stability, and the legal opinion of Noel Hutley, which I'm sure people are aware of, that directors need to be considering climate risk as part of their duties. Now I appreciate in our notice, thank you, for Slide 11, that Macquarie is now moving on climate risk disclosure. But I am concerned about your previous disclosure last year. I wonder if you could explain to the AGM, Mr. Warne, how it was that you were unaware of this industry initiative to disclose climate risk and championed by our own regulator, in reference to your seeking reelection.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Sure. Well, let's deal with that one first, given that one's freshest in my mind. Last year, I think you asked that question, the -- you used the acronym TCFD and I have to admit that did catch me unawares. I was certainly aware of it in terms of its longer name and I think that the announcements of the recommendations from the Task Force had only been recently released in June last year, as I believe. So that was remiss of me for not being aware of the acronym, but I should've been. I was certainly aware of the work the Task Force was doing and had I been better prepared, I would have been able to say that. So I do apologize and -- but I'm now well and truly aware of what TCFD stands for and the work that they -- that TCFD is doing. So I think that's -- does that answer your question? And as you will have seen, the company has made announcements back a few months ago that we are adopting the TCFD reporting recommendations, including the recommendation to do a scenario analysis based on a 2-degree Celsius increase in temperature. So that is underway and that is in process. So that is happening. In relation to the directors' and officers' liability insurance, I, just to be firm about that, I haven't asked that specific question of our insurance policy -- our insurance brokers. Maybe Mr. Leong might be able to tell me about that in particular, but if I move it to the generality, our role as directors in assessing climate change, we assess all the risks in relation to climate change as part of our overall risk management framework. We don't park it separately. This is one of the many things that we take into consideration in assessing risk related to any transaction or any business which we're involved in. So I would imagine that we are protected in that way, as long as we are not negligent or ignore those risks in the way that we would ignore any other risks. So the extent that we have that combined as part of our overall risk management framework, then I'd imagine it's covered by our insurance as -- in the same way as our other risk management process would be. But Dennis, can you confirm that, that is the case?\par \par \uc2 DENNIS LEONG\uc2 , HEAD OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIVISION, COMPANY SECRETARY & EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED: (inaudible) clauses in our D&O insurance.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Sorry, can you repeat that? The microphone wasn't on.\par \par \uc2 DENNIS LEONG\uc2 : I confirm that what the Chairman said is correct. We have no specific climate change clauses or exclusions in our D&O insurance policies.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Answer the question, is that fine? Good. Microphone 1, please.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce you to Mrs. [Gabby Duagy], registration number 0-0-2-8.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: My question also relates to the TCFD, which we now know means the Task Force and you have referred to that. But last year, when the company was asked about what -- whether company measures -- whether the company measures the carbon intensity of its loan assets. At that time, the answer was no. Is that still the case?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Yes, it is still the case. And the reason that we have not used that approach in our analysis is that our loans to carbon-intensive industries, particularly into coal, are less than 2% of our total loan exposures. So to stress test the impact on our whole portfolio of what is just 2% of our portfolio, it, to us, doesn't appear meaningful. But -- so we use other analysis about our total loan portfolio rather than stress testing just that one small piece, so it's a very small part of our total portfolio.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay, all right, because the Task Force itself states that banks should report significant credit exposure to carbon-related assets, and you don't consider that to be the case?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Well, 2% is -- we will certainly be reporting on, and we have committed to report on all the recommendations of the TCFD and we'll certainly do that. To date, we haven't done it because of what I've just said. If that is the -- if we can get down to preparing all that analysis and all that reporting that is a requirement, we will do that.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So by this time next year, we could expect to...?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: It will be in the annual report next year, if that's the requirement of the TCFD, it will be done. Number 3, please.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Ms. [Nicole Woodward], registration number 1-0-7-1, to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: My questions were did our company lobby the Victorian government directly or indirectly through other entities to privatize the Victoria land registry? And how do you see getting the contract for a privatized land registry in Victoria would fit with being a socially responsible corporation, given the profits that will be made off the registry will come at the cost of services the Victorian government currently provides? And what level of annual profit do Macquarie expect to make if it wins the bid to run the privatized land registry?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you for the question. It involves an element of detail and operational issues I'm not aware of. Nicholas, are you able to answer any of those questions?\par \par \uc2 NICHOLAS WILLIAM MOORE\uc2 : Well, I'm not sure that I can, Peter. But I might mention that we -- our MIRA team and Shemara is here obviously, was successful in the South Australian land titles sale. And I think it's proceeding well, so in terms of what's happening in Victoria, Shemara, I can't actually see you, but perhaps if there is a question to be answered there, I'm not sure there is.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Shemara, do you mind just going to the standing mic? Thanks, Shemara.\par \par \uc2 SHEMARA WIKRAMANAYAKE: First of all, we haven't lobbied the Victorian government at all in terms of the privatization. That's a decision by the government in terms of their policy initiatives and priorities. We are in the Asset Management business leading 1 of the 2 consortia that are bidding to buy the asset. And as far as profits for services, the government will set out what services it wants to make sure are protected and delivered to the community, as with many public assets that we take responsibility for looking after. And we will make an offer to manage the assets on that basis. But the government is not going to let go of standards in ensuring delivery of what the community needs.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you. Microphone 2, please.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce [Peter Milter], registration number 1-0-7-0, to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: In your -- in the climate change report and your statements in your presentation, Macquarie states that the reporting cycle will continue to evolve disclosures consistent with the relevant Task Force recommendations. And one of those recommendations, as you mentioned, is about the scenario report analysis. And I'd like to ask, when that scenario analysis will be released, how it will be conducted? And specifically, whether it will include businesses such as Quadrant Energy?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you. Well, in terms of the scenario analysis, I think the industry is still working out exactly how that scenario analysis will take place. Now we have committed to undertake that scenario analysis and once that process, I think, is -- been worked through by industry players about what -- how best to do it, then we will certainly be adopting those standards. Now in relation to this first year, the TCFD has actually said as part of its recommendations that -- well, it acknowledges that it needs to be phased approach, as all this is fairly new, and exactly what it means. But they recommend people start doing this analysis, but it needs to be phased and working out, which will probably take a number of years. Certainly, from our approach, we're going to take a risk-based approach, so we will be starting with those assets which are most carbon-intensive. So that will be our investments in fossil fuels, will be the area where we will be starting. And should Quadrant still be part of the Macquarie portfolio at that process, I would imagine that, that will certainly be included.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Second part of the question. As a financial services company, does the board believe \uc2 Macquarie Group\uc2  is exposed to a high level of climate risk?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: It's probably as much a personal view than a board view at this stage, because I don't think I've asked the board that question specifically. Macquarie, our Macquarie businesses and our Macquarie portfolio of loans and equity investments is a portfolio which is in continual change. Now we don't buy assets that we expect are going to be there for 5, for 10, 20, 25 years, like perhaps an energy company would be. Most of our investments are relatively short-term, being 2, 5, 7, up to 10 years, but -- so that we would think over the next 10 years, in 10 years' time, there will probably be very unlikely to be any asset that is currently on our balance sheet, still on our balance sheet. It will have turned over many times by then, so -- and as a result of that, because of the nature of our business, we will be evolving with market standards, community standards, market risks, the demands of our clients in particular, what they will be doing. So trying to assess what our balance sheet would look like in 10 years' time is difficult and if not impossible. So we'll be moving with the market pressures, market standards and market opportunities over that time.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just a follow-up question. (inaudible).\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Excuse me, we do have a 2 -- we do have a -- excuse me, we do have a 2 question limit. Is this a quick question or is this another long one?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Very quick. Is climate risk something that is considered when investments are made?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Absolutely. And I've said that already. Climate risk is part of our broad risk management framework. It is taken into consideration in every investment, every loan, every business that we buy that will be incorporated to our business. It's an active consideration, and we have active policies and procedures for that, as set out in our annual report. So our [ESI] reporting goes into great detail about what our policy is and what our procedures are. Now microphone 1?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I'd like to introduce Mr. Allan Goldin to the meeting, registration number 10-52.\par \par \uc2 ALLAN GOLDIN: Hello, Mr. Chairman. I'm here as a shareholder in my own right and representing the \uc2 Australian Shareholders' Association\uc2 . I'm holding 416 proxies, which represents 415,000 shares, well, more than 415,000 shares. I assume that this should -- the 2 questions I'll ask are all on financial statements?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: No, you can ask any question on anything.\par \par \uc2 ALLAN GOLDIN: Okay, well, I'll go and just do these 2 on financial and come back later. In June 2017, when there were rumors that Macquarie might leave Australia, Mr. Moore said, "No plans, but always reviewing options." So we've discussed this, but I wasn't able to put it in my voting intention, so my question is, what would it take for Macquarie to no longer call Australia home, is one? And my second one -- do you want them both at the same time?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Yes, fire away.\par \par \uc2 ALLAN GOLDIN: Macquarie is a very complex business. So understandably, it would take auditors a little while to get a handle on it. But having the same firm for 14 years means the perception of independence starts getting a bit frayed. So the question is, is your audit contract being put out for tender?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: The answer to your first question is no. We are not contemplating moving our head office. Asking what it would take, well, you're asking a hypothetical that I find impossible to answer, unfortunately. All I can say is that moving your head office is a very large decision for any company, and so it would take a considerable motivation to do that. And I can't imagine what that could possibly be, but it would not be a decision taken lightly, and it would be a very momentous decision. So that's about all I can say to answer that question.\par \par \uc2 ALLAN GOLDIN: So we should look forward to seeing Macquarie calling Australia home for many years to come?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Unless there is something major that -- which would cause us to change, so -- you're asking a hypothetical and I can't possibly think of a scenario that would cause us to do that. So that would be my -- the answer to the first one. The answer to the second one, in relation to the auditor. Yes, you've identified the trade-off between the perceived independence of the auditor versus the knowledge and skill, depth of understanding of the organization that the, having the auditor there for a long time brings to the benefit of the company. We have taken the view that Macquarie is a large, broadly dispersed global company, that the advantages of having the same firm as the auditor outweighs the perceived benefit of change of independence by having a new firm. That is -- we are rigorous about accepting the fees that the auditors charge and make sure that, that is competitive. We also, of course, regularly change the audit partner every 5 years, as we have to under the Australian regulation. But no, we haven't contemplated changing the -- putting the audit out to tender.\par \par \uc2 ALLAN GOLDIN: So there's no thought of seeing what the rest of the market is going to say if you -- 3 or 4 firms, basically is what we're talking about.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: We have -- all I can say is we review internally, do we believe we're getting value for money, an independent audit, quality people on the project and getting -- that our best interests are being served? We review the performance of the auditor annually and our view to date has been that we are best served, given the nature of Macquarie's business, particularly the global nature of the business, that we're best served in staying where we are. Number 3?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Philip Laird], registration number 0-2-2-6, to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Welcome, Phil.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and for the presentation this morning. I saw in the presentation -- 2 questions. The presentation this morning noted investments in airports, planes, toll roads and cars, which incidentally, are energy-intensive modes of transport. But could you please elaborate on Macquarie's holdings in rail tracks or rolling stock? That's my first question.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Right. And to the best of my knowledge, we have, in our Leasing asset finance portfolio, we have rolling stock in Europe and the U.K. The actual dollar sum of it, I cannot tell you off the top of my head, but we do have some there. And in our Funds, I believe, and I'm looking to Shemara here, I think we have -- do we have a train line servicing one of the airports in London, don't we? Not in the Funds, it's on the balance sheet. So it is on the company's balance sheet?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Yes. So that's our belief. And do we have anything else in trains?\par \par \uc2 SHEMARA WIKRAMANAYAKE: (inaudible)\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: No rail assets in the other funds.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Perhaps next year, given they're climate-friendly.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Are you a fan of Planes, Trains and Automobiles? Is that a movie that you've...?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I like efficient rail services. And I'd like to see more of them in Australia, so I don't have to go overseas so often to enjoy high-speed rail or even fairly fast rail. For that, I have to go out of state to Victoria. My second question is, Mr. Chairman, annual reports have noted, with the amounts qualified, political donations and that's been raised before. A quick look at this year's annual report, I couldn't see any, is that because we're -- Macquarie is no longer making political donations, which -- or did I overlook it? Or is it not being made and not there?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Look, I think it's there somewhere. I can't tell you what page, but I believe it's there. But I can tell you what it is. It's very in line with what our policy has been in previous years. Nothing has changed. I think our contributions as recorded were in the last year in FY '18, $250,550, which is down from the previous year, which was $336,000. I'd like to re -- just again, tell you about those, that the vast majority of those, I think in excess of 90% of those, are fees that we pay to attend events of the various political parties. So they're annual conferences, they're dinners, they're business associations. Now we disclose those fully in our annual report and in our political reportings, but we are not obliged to. That's not a requirement. We want to make full disclosure and full transparency to our shareholders and to other interested stakeholders. We would note that other people don't, so -- but -- and we see them there at the same functions, so it's no surprise. So look, we have been totally transparent. Last year, it was $250,000. We believe it's important. We believe that to be, because we're in an industry which is heavily regulated and very much affected by government policy, it's important for us to be at events where these issues are debated, are explained, to be able to talk to politicians and their advisers about the issues they're taking into consideration in developing policy. We think it's important for plotting the future of our business and bringing -- having input into that and we think our shareholders and stakeholders expect us to be there and taking part in that debate.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And this is bipartisan or tripartisan?\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 , HEAD OF COMMODITIES & GLOBAL MARKETS GROUP, \uc2 MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED\uc2 : Bipartisan. It's on Page 30, I'm told, of the annual the report. All right, let's go to #2. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce [Robert Divasari] registration number 1 -- I'm sorry 0110 to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Welcome, Robert.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. One quick question. I see you're investing in a rubbish to power plant. I'm wondering what review you're undertaking in terms of actual emissions that, that plant is putting out in view of what's been happening in Western Sydney and many years ago there was power plant in [Wangara], which is now no longer operating so apart from the green, apart from the climate change issue, what other reviews does the company take in terms of emissions from those sorts of plants?\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Again, I personally can't answer that question. Nicholas, or someone on board here that could?\par \par \uc2 NICHOLAS WILLIAM MOORE\uc2 : I think Tim can probably -- it's in Tim's area. And I think talking about the overall impact, Tim, of the business in terms of 600,000 tonnes of garbage that's burning a year replacing over 200,000 tonnes of coal. And the due diligence we've done, I think, would be a very good topic to talk about. So if we can get a microphone to \uc2 Tim Bishop\uc2 , the head of \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Just get him a microphone.\par \par \uc2 TIMOTHY CAMERON BISHOP\uc2 , HEAD OF \uc2 MACQUARIE CAPITAL\uc2 , \uc2 MACQUARIE GROUP LIMITED\uc2 : If you sort of step back a little bit from the question, everything that we do in that green energy space is under the brand of the Green Investment Group that Peter mentioned earlier that we acquired from the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2 . And therefore, what goes with that is a responsibility to the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  and an undertaking that was given then that we'd be investing in businesses and opportunities that are consistent with the green objectives. So every time we make one of those investments under that Green Investment Group brand, we go through a particular exercise to ensure that it satisfies the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2 's objectives and desires when they established the Green Investment Group. And the waste plant, I assume it's the one in Korea that's been mentioned, by definition, therefore, satisfies that criteria.\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : (inaudible)? The Dublin one?\par \par \uc2 TIMOTHY CAMERON BISHOP\uc2 : In -- so in Dublin, with Covanta again, we go through the proper due diligence process to ensure that what we're doing is consistent, as I said, with the Green Investment Group objective. So everything that we do is in line with the objectives that we agreed with the \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  when we acquired the Green Investment Group.\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Thank you. #1. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Reginald Lock], registration number 0182 to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you. Chairman, for some years, I worked for a general manager who was constantly referring to the helicopter view, the opportunities, the threats, and a couple of other points. We've heard today very much and very fully about the opportunities. What are the threats going forward? Now I'd typically point to 3: North Korea, Iran and what I would generally refer to as the Trump factor. Would you mind commenting on that, please?\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Geez, that's a tough one. In relation to the first 2, Iran and North Korea, they are views that, issues that we take on board as part of our country risk reviews that the impact that they're either going to have as some -- in relation to their own countries. And I don't believe we have any exposure to Iran and -- no direct exposure to Iran, and I don't think any direct exposure to North Korea either but -- and also how they would impact their neighbors, and the impact that, that's likely to have. Now those risks, both those countries have been around for a long time and they're still there, and they're probably likely to be around for some time yet. So we have to -- in sizing our risk, we have to consider what the worst case would be in relation to those -- those particular countries, what the worst case could be and can we absorb that risk. We don't -- we have to make an assessment of how likely we think it is but even if it -- and how good the opportunity is. Even if it was a good opportunity if we're -- when we assess the worst-case estimates that would jeopardize the organization or -- then of course, we would not do that. So that's part of our risk assessment in everything we do. That's one of the strengths of our risk assessment is that we always assume as part of that, of assessing the risk, the worst possible outcome that we could possibly identify. In relation to the U.S. and Mr. Trump, I really do think that one is above my pay grade, to be honest. But nevertheless, look, it is, as I said, there are things happening every day. If you look back at the announcements that happened over the last 12 months, they've been obviously substantial and something new and intriguing every day that we can focus on, but despite all the alarming rhetoric and everything that's happened, the U.S. economy continues to boom. The global economy is still very strong. Life goes on, GDP goes on. We are -- the world is in a pretty good place at the moment. Now -- but having said that, there are some alarming things, the whole tariff thing. Is that going to lead to sort of a downturn in economic activity or does it, again, affect a particular country in a serious way? These are still things we have to take on board. And again, we have to stress test to make sure that, on a worse case estimate on any of those things, any of the transactions we do, the businesses we buy, can we absorb the worst-case loss out of those things. That's the criteria we use. Thank you. #3.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Henry Tiu], registration number 2059 to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Welcome, Henry.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Firstly, I think you and your teams are doing a fantastic job. As a minority shareholder, we thank you very much. On the other hand looking from the angle, I noticed you have already done a lot of things for the larger community. But my question, my focus is really on the smaller communities, especially yourself and most likely how incumbent Chief Executive and incoming executive. In other words, what I'm saying is can Macquarie be accused of being monopolizing some of the business such that they can extract additional profit, in fact, maybe extraordinary profit above the world standard? For example, the Macquarie airport parking, now that is, I think, amongst the highest charge in the world. Can you or our Chief Executive Officer address with the fellow executive that maybe the larger community can benefit?\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Well, just to relate very quickly to the Sydney Airport parking, Macquarie has no involvement with Sydney Airport at all. We are not responsible, we are not part of the management, the ownership. It is a listed company and it is under a separate board and under separate management. And so we were involved years ago. But with quite a number of years now, it must be going back at least 5 years, we have not -- we don't have any involvement. So in that position, we can't help you, I'm afraid.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Surely, you still have enough influence on the decision.\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE\uc2 : Well, sometimes, we would like to think we do, Henry, but unfortunately, we don't. It has its own management and own board and own shareholders who want to see their particular return. So I can't help you with that one at all, I'm afraid. In terms of your broader point, though, about communities generally, we do take, as we've shown in the slides today and in the video, we do take our community obligations very, very seriously. So much of what Macquarie does is providing community services one way or another through our funds management business or through our teams at \uc2 Macquarie Capital\uc2  business or through Gary and Ben's financing businesses that we are providing all sorts of facilities to the community, which are improving standards of living around the world not in Australia -- not just in Australia. In addition to that, the work that the foundation does -- and it's Australia's biggest foundation, $330 million since its last -- $100 million it would have been in the last 3 or 4 years, $28 million in this last year plus all the time that our people donate. So we do take our community obligations very seriously. And they're not just obligations, we actually want our people to be involved. We want -- [our people don't think] it's all right for people -- for us to be sitting in a big office working away in an isolated ivory tower. We actually love our people getting out in the real world talking to the real people, solving real problems in the community. We think that makes them better adjusted people, being aware of the community and the real issues in the community, particularly some of the tough issues in the community. It makes them better in their jobs so we applaud that. We encourage them to do that and we're very happy to support them on that. We're back to #2. Thank you.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce [Peter Burger], registration number 0017.\par \par \uc2 ANDREW JAMES DOWNE: Welcome, Peter.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: In relation to a matter a couple of questions ago about our waste management plant in England, in terms of Macquarie, I know for years one of the things that's kept us ahead of the rest has been our outstanding risk management. Specifically, do we know what levels of dioxins are coming out of the chimney of that waste management plant in England in terms of risk management? Because there can be cases of people sue for dioxin poison.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: I don't know the answer to that question. Tim, could you help on that? Or is it something we should take on notice?\par \par \uc2 TIMOTHY CAMERON BISHOP: Well, I'm happy to take it on notice, but I would say that I'm confident that we would've looked at all of the green-related issues as part of the investment process that we went through.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Nicholas, is your microphone on?\par \par \uc2 NICHOLAS WILLIAM MOORE: Just to add on that. This project is actually in Dublin, the waste 22 plant that you saw. It was the subject of an enormous amount of work as you can guess. It's right in the heart of Dublin, with the local community. So I think the council worked on a team for more than 10 years in terms of actually working through the planning approvals and working through the scrubbers and everything necessary to ensure that it's safe within the local community. So it has been extensively reviewed. Our team when they actually did the acquisition also extensively reviewed it, and we have worked with Covanta, the other half on it, for quite a few years. So I think the amount of the work the team have done, have certainly looked at the issue you mentioned. And as Peter said, we can certainly come back and give you precise detail, but it is a very well worked project. And the reason we put it up is it's working actually very effectively at the moment.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I notice in passing though, neither of you were able to say the word dioxin.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thank you. Microphone 1, please.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Sam Schwartzburg] registration number 0176.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, as a longtime shareholder, I just wish to thank both management and staff of Macquarie Bank for producing terrific results and wishing Nicholas a healthy and happy retirement and a lot of luck to Shemara. Thank you very much again for the results.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Thanks, Sam. That's appreciated. #2.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Jason John] registration number 0039.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: This question might be a little bit out of left field, but how do you manage to have such a high quality of management and executives in your banks such that year in, year out, you are able to confound the general investment climate? How do you manage to keep that staff? Is headhunting a real problem? How do you manage to vet your staff in such a way that you are able to maintain such phenomenal performance as I said for many years?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: What a great question. I have a secret source. There is a very long history at Macquarie and very long processes. I think I can tell you a little story. When I first joined the board of Macquarie, 11 years ago now, I asked Nicholas, what is -- what is Macquarie? What's Macquarie's business model? And Nicholas told me at the time, the aim is to [haul] out the best quality people we can find and help them solve our clients' problems, which I thought was a bit dismissive as a new director at the time, that it was -- I also thought I was getting brushed off there. But as I reflected on that over history, that is exactly what Macquarie does. That is the essence of Macquarie, and that is about going out and finding the best quality people. So it's attracting, motivating, retaining and rewarding the best quality people we can find to solve our clients' problems. So that has been the philosophy of Macquarie going back a very long time. We put a lot of effort into hiring our people, finding our people. We're very diligent about the search process, about the appointment process. We don't appoint people lightly. You know, we appoint a lot of people every year. We don't appoint that lightly and people we then motivate by giving them responsibility, making it a meritocracy where people who drive the business, who produce the results get rewarded, get promoted and take on increasing amounts of responsibility. So that's a very high satisfaction for the people, the good people who can generate the results for Macquarie, and they've always got plenty of challenge and future in front of them. We don't put them in a box and say you can only do that. We say get out there and find new things to do for your clients. So that is the process. We have a very tight risk control from the center so when they go out and find the new clients and find the new business, new project, and they bring it back it's vigorously examined internally, but it's from this bottom-up process, so of giving people plenty of challenge, plenty of responsibility and the opportunity to really shine. Now going with that, of course, when we build great businesses, what we have built, and they're market-leading, global-leading businesses in many of the things that we do, they are the best in the world. They are the best that we can find anywhere in the world. They've built businesses that are better than other people's business in the world in very competitive markets. So we -- as part of that, we have to remunerate them accordingly because they're highly sought-after people. So there's a remuneration that goes with that. And then when we do remunerate them, we retain a lot of their remuneration for a long period of time. In Nicholas's case, his profit share he gets the last [3 years] 80% of it is retained and invested in Macquarie Equity and that's not -- that's paid out over years 3 to 7. So 7 years, he's got to wait to get all his remuneration. And it's invested in Macquarie stock. So he's got a strong vested interest, as does all our management team, having a very strong vested interest in doing things today that will grow the business over a long period of time because there's no point in taking a shortcut today for a deal today if that's going to hurt us in the future. Everything that we need to do needs to be yes, good for the business today, but needs to grow the business in the future so that when he gets his Macquarie shares in 7 years' time, they will be worth more than they are now, and they will be certainly even more valuable. And if something was to go wrong, of course, it never happened with Nicholas, but if something did to someone else, if they did do something stupid, we do fire them, they lose all that retention. That's gone. So there's this incredible discipline. All these elements are reinforcing to the right sort of behaviors that we want to have amongst our people so there is an incentive to perform, incentive to get out there and build a business, be entrepreneurial, work hard and [this time] in the future, get remunerated for that, have that remuneration locked back in Macquarie shares for a long period of time so that the future is even better. So it provides us challenge and encouragement and drive, but at the same time provides us this risk control. There's no point in doing anything stupid because if it will come back to bite you in the future, this will all be work for nothing. So not only will we search for the good people, the best we can find, make it an attractive place to work, give good job satisfaction, then have a reward structure that reinforces all those things. We're back up to #1, I think, aren't we?\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mrs. [Patricia Beale], 0278 registration number to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and everybody else. I've been impressed as usual with the breadth and the expertise of everybody from Macquarie, and I've been particularly impressed this year how quickly and how much has gone into various sorts of green or renewable type -- energy type projects. Could you give an overall estimate of that and how it's broken down, whether these are annuity type investments or capital management type ones? And do they alter the risk structure or the overall balance of the company going forwards?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Certainly, Patricia. I think they would fit -- broadly speaking fit into 2 things. In Macquarie Capital, in Tim's area, there are a large number of development projects. So projects which are -- that our clients, be they governments or construction companies, have that they want to build a new facility. With those, we get involved in financing them and often in a partnership with our client, constructing them. And when they're finished we would tend to sell them to a long-term investor, so that's -- and there is a continual pipeline of these types of projects that we're continuing to work on. There are new ones coming in as the old ones are going out. So this is happening all the time. And those projects are around the world. At the same time, we have our funds management business, which are a long-term investor and they would buy, look at some of those projects and acquire them and hold them for usually 10 years for their clients as part of a fund, but we also provide those and offer those projects to a whole range of other investors, global investors of all sorts, be it sovereign funds or insurance companies or pension funds in all countries in the world. So they're the 2 areas in which they -- how we are involved, in both of those things. In terms of green fuel risk profile, it has been an area, a very strong growth force in the last 2 or 3 years, in particular, I mean we've been involved in renewable energy back over 10 years, but that has really grown substantially in the last 2 or 3 -- or last, yes, 2 to 3 years in particular. So we have more of that on our balance sheet now than we have ever had as a proportion of our balance sheet, but all of those projects go through exactly the same risk assessment as everything else we do. So in the sense of, is it adding risk to the balance sheet? Not in any way that is -- that any of the other things that we do. Sure, we do [a new] business [rue] that adds some risk, but we have plenty of capital to handle that and this goes through our normal risk assessment.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So does that alter the long-term overall balance between 70% annuity approximately to the 30%?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: It's been 70-30 for the last couple of years. Now we have put a lot of these things on, on the balance sheet -- not a lot, more than usual, in the last year or 2 so that might swing it a bit the other way in the next year or 2. But in the big picture now, it's not changing the overall profile of the company. #3? #2.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Peter Shorten], registration number 0282.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Welcome, Peter.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You've seen America pull out of the Paris Agreement and the 2 other big [oravis] in the year and China not worry about the Paris Agreement. There seems to be a bit of a groundswell coming up in Australia now saying that Australia should pull out of the Paris Agreement. You've probably heard a lot of the radio stations and various other people calling for the Prime Minister to bite the bullet. How would that affect this company, especially with -- if they were to reduce renewables and over a period of time? I know we've got a lot of investment there, but if something did happen and the pressure was put on and the [reps] decide the only way they're going to get reelected they better do something, how would that affect the company?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Well, firstly, I would say is, what we're doing in renewables is more global than it is Australian. Now we have some projects in Australia, but the vast majority of them are spread throughout Europe and Asia and even some are in the U.S. So our actual exposure in Australia is not that great, and the reason for that is Australia is a very competitive place. It's actually a bit more lucrative to do green things elsewhere in the world. But we do have some projects in Australia, can't take away from that. Look, we think that the activity around Paris is almost yesterday's argument. The cost of energy or the price of energy now being generated by renewables, be it solar, wind or any of the other projects is now below that of the cost of fossil fuel-generated energy -- electricity. So this is not about people being forced into it to make global targets or Paris targets. This is an issue of, this is the cheapest way to generate electricity. And so it's now an economic argument, not an environmental argument. This is going to happen whether people like it or not. Yes, there is an issue about how to get more reliability into the renewable system for when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow, as I say. And so a lot of work is going into how to get battery storage or stored hydro, those sort of projects to add more reliability to the system but that's happening, that will happen. This is now, it's a price issue. This is not people doing it because they have to. This is going to happen whether people like it or not.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to reintroduce Mr. [Allen Goldman], registration number 1052 to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman is it okay for me to come back? Okay. We all know the Macquarie people are the brightest in the room and that's why we're all shareholders. As such, they deserve to be well paid. But really, you can trust our shareholders with more information so we can understand their pay. Firstly, a comment before a couple of questions. Each year, I read between 30 and 40 remuneration reports in some depth. But it took me 3 meetings and a few rereads to understand your profit share scheme. Now I admit it, I may not be the cleverest person around, but can we possibly be clearer next year on this area? That's a comment, that's all that is. Question.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Before you ask your question, I would just have to say that we go through inordinate lengths to try and make our process as clear and understandable and as transparent as possible. While I'm sorry that you found it difficult to understand, we usually get accolades from many shareholders about how much information we do disclose and how transparent it is and how our system works. So I'm disappointed for you, but I couldn't let that comment stand as (inaudible)...\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I just may be at the lower level than your smarter people you usually deal with. Now anyone who read ASA's voting intentions, which hopefully everyone did, knows that Nicholas Moore's actual take-home pay this year was $24,039,902. But if you read the statutory accounts in your annual report, they would think he was paid $4.5 million less. You have told us, not just this year, to publish actual take-home pay would be too confusing. And to make it clear would take many more pages in your already lengthy remuneration report. If we provided you with some suggestions as to how you can explain this in simpler terms and you accepted our suggestions, would you publish actual take-home pay [and not a] statutory item next year?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Probably not. And let me tell you why, and we've had discussions about this many times, so this is for the benefit of everybody else. We think the concept of take-home pay in Macquarie's world is sort of a meaningless type of concept. Take-home pay, for what everyone who doesn't understand that term, is the amount of either cash or the amount of invested equity which somebody gets in a particular year. And as I explained earlier, our remuneration system, a lot of our remuneration is deferred over a long period of time. So someone's, in Nicholas's case, his take-home pay this year included equity awards that were made 7 years ago. That was part of his performance 7 years ago. So of that number, I think you said $24 million, and I'm not disputing that, that's the number, on my reconciliation of that, $8 million of that $24 million is actually the share price growth that's occurred over the last 7 years. So that's -- that's not a reward for his performance, his work in this last year. That's sort of an accident of history and a recognition of his great work over a long period of time.\par \par \uc2 We think the remuneration report, the elements of the remuneration report are to recognize the remuneration we have given someone for their performance in the last financial year. What they got 7 years ago, what's happened to the share price over the last 7 years, yes, it's interesting, but it's not really relevant to the remuneration report. What we need to have in the remuneration report is an explanation of why he got paid what he got paid in this last financial year. History is interesting but not relevant to the rem report. So that's our strong view, and that's the rationale.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. I'll still make some suggestions. Okay. Another thing just on this transparency. You have 2 forms for the senior executives. There's 2 forms of bonus. One is the profit share, which happens -- which is based upon the profits that are generated by that -- their responsibilities in that particular year, and that goes all the way through the company. Then your key management people have a separate thing, which is called profit share units. And by the way, I think that's a bit confusing because it's something where PSUs -- it's something that will be delivered in the future if you go and have some hurdles that are met. So to me, you've got profit share here, you call it some other name but anyhow. We're able to calculate that you have awarded $30 million of these potential PSUs to the executive committee. Can you tell us how it was calculated, how much each received? We know that Nicholas Moore's was based upon some fair value measure, which worked out to $4.2 million. How about the others? The other people who -- how was it decided? And how much did they get?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Well, just to explain to the remaining audience, what the PSUs are for. The PSUs or performance share units are an extra layer of remuneration. It's not -- it's significant but not the major part of their remuneration which rewards members of our executive committee for their role in managing the firm as a whole as opposed to their particular individual business line. And again, it's significant but not the major part of their remuneration. It moves differently to their profit shares, which their profit share more relates to their particular area of business and their performance of that -- of their particular business. So that's why we have the 2 separate amounts. As you said, they're amounts which have future contingent performance against them, dependent on our growth in earnings per share and our return on equity. One's a relative measure against a panel of comparative companies and the other is between 2 fixed hurdles. Our earnings per share growth number is -- it cuts in at 7.5% growth compound and cuts out at 12%, [up around] compound. So that's the basis. We publish and vote on today Nicholas's PSU amounts. The other amounts are disclosed in the remuneration report for the other [KNP] group. They are relatively constant from year to year. They are published as part of the rem report. We don't go into great detail because they're not the major part of their remuneration. It's not an enormous amount of detail we go through, but I'm not sure what it is you would like us to do. I don't know that that's ...\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Well, there's an amount that each of them has. And I can't imagine it was plucked out of the air. I mean usually...\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Oh, sorry, in that case, let me explain. That is more relative to a level of historic earnings and a level of their responsibility.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So it's based on the past for the future.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Roughly on the past. It's roughly smooth all the time so it doesn't jump around a hell a lot from year to year.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. No, that's fine. I just wanted to understand because usually in most companies you see it as a proportion of their base but, that doesn't make sense for you and I agree with that but I just wondered what measurement is used. I do have one more question. I could wait until everyone goes or I could ask it now. And this relates to Mr. Cairns. As Gordon Cairns said when he was -- in his nice speech, which was a good speech, he is the Chairman of 2 of Australia's largest companies in Origin and Woolworths. And he is a director here so in our terms that's at least 5 companies, which takes it within ASA's shareholder -- workload requirements, I accept, but we've got 2 very large companies, both of which may be traveling better than they were a couple of years ago thanks to his excellent work, however either one of those could have a major problem anytime. I know that he said that he has sufficient time, but what happens if one of those blows up? Will he step aside from this board or -- it is a big workload.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: It is a big workload. He must be a big worker, that's all I can say. As I said in my earlier remarks, his attendance at Macquarie is exemplary. His preparation for every meeting that we have, he's thoroughly read all the papers and thought about them. He contributes actively at all our meetings. I could not criticize his performance as a Macquarie director at all. So that's all I can say about his performance at Macquarie and we're delighted to invite him back to have another term at Macquarie. If something happens in the future, then people have to deal with it. I mean, it's not only if there's a blow up at the company, there's ill health. There's all sorts of things that can come along that affects people's lives going forward. You can't -- I don't -- I personally believe you can't necessarily prepare your life [living your get] for the worst-case estimate of extra time you're going to have to do. If things arise, then those -- then we'll have to deal with them. But when Gordon was the chair of Woolworths and at Origin Energy when both were without a CEO, he obviously had a lot of work to do at those companies [thorough] significant issues that were facing both those companies simultaneously and his work commitment and performance at Macquarie was exemplary. So I feel like that's all I can say and deal with that. His performance as a director has been great.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Yes, #2.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. [Murray Kidney], registration number 0023.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Welcome, [Murray].\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start by congratulating the board and Mr. Moore and his team. As a long-standing shareholder I have to say I'm very happy with the performance of the company. Secondly, there was some criticism of the presentations and the disclosure. I found both were excellent and your report very comprehensive, the presentation today was outstanding I thought. My question is, there was a mention in your presentation about the \b \highlight22\uc2 banking Royal Commission\b0 \highlight\uc2 . You didn't go into very much about it. I was wondering if you or any other members of the board would like to elaborate on what you see as the potential outcomes of the Royal Commission? What it means for Macquarie and the Australian economy generally and what you think you might need to do about it?\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Well, that's a bit of a big crystal ball, Murray, there for us to deal with. Again, just to reiterate where we have been involved, the Royal Commission has sought information from us, reports and on a whole range of issues going back 10 years, in some cases, which we have supplied to them. They have actually asked us to supply witness statements that could potentially have increased during one of the sessions, but nobody was, star witnesses were asked to deliver. And of course, we'll continue to deliver that information when requested. So we've supplied enormous amounts of information to the Royal Commission. And of course, Nicholas has said he's been requested to be available and to talk about policy issues in November. So that's where we've been. So where to from here? Well, I think we're all looking eagerly at the interim report, which we delivered in September, to get a feeling for where the Royal Commission is going and the recommendations they're likely to make, other observations that they're going to make. I think it's at that point then we might see the direction they were going. I think it is -- I think we've all been surprised at some of the things that have come out of the Royal Commission, but I would actually encourage people to remember this is not a Royal Commission into misconduct. This is not a Royal Commission into conduct generally. This is certainly not a Royal Commission into good conduct. You're only expecting bad stories to come out of this and there may have been some bad stories, they accept that. But a vast majority of people in the Australian financial services get good service. They're very happy with their performance. They actually like their bank, believe it or not, and are very happy with things. So my only counsel would be, yes, were bad things have happened and bad things will always happen. We're talking about people here. Mistakes happen. The real issue is what we do about them, how quickly we get on and fix them and ensure that they don't happen again and I think that -- but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater here. We run a continued good financial system where people get good levels of service, get good advice, get -- for products we want at reasonable prices. We don't want to change the world here and have -- actually, have services not available or prices of the services that are available to get prohibitive for ordinary people to access. So I think that would be my observation as a more personal note. We haven't talked about that on the board, but it's a personal view. Nicholas, as an observer of these things have you got any -- something contrary to that or in addition to that?\par \par \uc2 NICHOLAS WILLIAM MOORE: No, I think you said it all.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: #3.\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I would like to introduce Mr. [Ian Butler], registration number 0144 to the meeting.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Welcome, [Ian].\par \par \uc2 UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to follow on from other questions, [Henry] particularly said very good presentation and that the small shareholder or small person might we see some benefits he wanted a discount at the airport. Mine's a little bit different today. As a recently retired financial planner of 35 years, I take more interest in my clients now that my money's there as well. I'm retired. When I advise clients, we had gone back a number of years. You had the [Kohl's], that had the discount card for their shareholders, and I could not sell their shares because the wife said I'm going to discount my shopping, love it (inaudible) discounted the clients. And bring it forward to today, I've got shares in the National Bank. And I've got a discount card here (inaudible) saying you get 20 or 30 basis points added to your time deposit if you come into the bank in the next month. From Macquarie's point of view and my shareholders and yourselves going forward, financial services will be easier to control than the shopping cart, but will there be a [lowvy] screen for shareholders that [offer] some basis points for Macquarie cash management account. Most people got that. Too many deposits and that is there in short been given by the board to have sticky shareholders because if I get a [really valuable] discount above market to hold their shares and work with the bank I think it could be given to the board in that matter.\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: It's certainly not something that we've discussed with the board since we've (inaudible) I'm afraid to say but it's something we certainly focused on customer loyalty and what else we might be able to do. So thank you for that suggestion. I'll take it on board. I think we have -- do we still have Greg here or not? No, unfortunately, Greg had to leave. So I can't ask him for any input there, but I don't think it's anything we have discussed, but I'll be sure I pass it on.\par \par \uc2 Now I don't believe that there are any more questions. As there are no further questions, I now ask for a summary of all the available proxy votes on the motions to be shown on the screens behind me. Please note that all open proxies given to the Chairman of the meeting will be voted by me in favor of all items of business. As you can see, the proxy votes were strongly in favor of all the proposed resolutions. If you have not yet cast your votes, I now ask you to do so. Representatives from our registry, Link Market Services, are available for assistance if you have any questions about how to vote. Link will also act as the returning officer determining the results of the polls. I'll just take some time now for anyone to fill out their voting cards, and we'll have some -- the boxes around to collect the voting items.\par \par \uc2 (Voting)\par \par \uc2 PETER HASTINGS WARNE: Has everyone who wishes to vote now done so? Please raise your hand if you still have a voting card, and we'll have someone come around and collect it. Are there any other... There are outside if you need to leave, if you want to wait, we'll come and pick that up. But if you wanted to leave, there are boxes on the outside of the door. It's very important that we get them from the directors. Right. On the left here. Has everyone who wishes to vote now done so? Hold on. Okay. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The polls will now be closed. The results will be announced [at the IS6] as soon as practical this afternoon. That concludes the business of the Annual General Meeting. Thank you for your attendance and your support during the year. Good afternoon.\par \par \uc2 [Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.\par \par \uc2 In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

aside money from their pre-tax income during good years, to use later during tough times.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COffsetting FMDs against other farm loans will enable producers to save on interest

interest rates on drought-affected farmers was also welcome.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is counterproductive and unfair for farmers who are struggling to meet repayments to then be hit by even higher charges, which often contributes to foreclosure actions being taken by the bank.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe congratulate \uc2 NAB\uc2  on the announcements they have made and urge other

terms of reference dictated by the \u8220\'20\'1Cbig four banks\u8217\'20\'19\u8217\'20\'19 has been echoed at the highest levels of the Federal Government in recent weeks.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino lost his life\u8217\'20\'19s work in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 when he claims his bank \u8220\'20\'1Cpanicked\u8221\'20\'1D and pulled their support for his high-rise boutique apartment complex and coffee shop in the Rockhampton CBD.\par \par \uc2 It was part of the $14 million property portfolio he said he lost as the bank forced the sale of his assets, systemically pushing him into bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn my case all receivers and managers, including forensic accountants, deliberately turned a blind eye to the law and illicit trading practices,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Comino said.\par \par \b \highlight22\uc2 Banking royal commission\b0 \highlight\uc2  hearings in late June focused on the rushed mortgagee sales of farmland by bank-appointed receivers, where some properties were sold for 30 to 50 per cent below their value.\par \par \uc2 The commission stated the conduct of receivers would not be assessed as it did not fall within any of the categories defined as a financial services entity.\par \par \uc2 However, Treasurer Scott Morrison later seemed at odds with this statement, telling Parliament Question Time that receivers would come under scrutiny from the royal commission.\par \par \uc2 There has been no clarification about whether the scope of the inquiry will be broadened to include prudential legislation and entities, like receivers, acting on behalf of banks.\par \par \uc2 This week, it was reported One Nation Senator \uc2 Pauline Hanson\uc2  had written to the Prime Minister calling for the commission to be extended, arguing the inquiry had failed to look into relationships between banks, receivers, liquidators and insolvency firms.\par \par \uc2 Although the focus of this latest outrage has been centred on fire sales of agricultural land, there are parallels between the experiences of agricultural borrowers and Mr Comino.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino, who detailed his \u8220\'20\'1Cfinancial homicide\u8221\'20\'1D to The Morning Bulletin last month, said he had \u8220\'20\'1Cnever been more aggrieved\u8221\'20\'1D than watching ANZ head of lending services Benjamin Steinberg testify at the royal commission.\par \par \uc2 With the support of Member for Flynn Ken O\u8217\'20\'19Dowd and Senator John Williams, Mr Comino met with Mr Steinberg to discuss his grievances with ANZ in the wake of the property sales, but nothing came of it.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino said Mr Steinberg told him the grievances should be directed to the appointed receivers rather than ANZ.\par \par \uc2 Failure to achieve fair and true value of the properties is one of Mr Comino\u8217\'20\'19s biggest concerns with the bank\u8217\'20\'19s conduct, and an issue which evidence at the royal commission suggests is systemic in the finance industry.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe receivers are a lot to blame in the banks\u8217\'20\'19 failure to receive a full market value,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, they are still colluding and collaborating with the banks to accept final sale prices without fair agreement of the vendor.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In Mr Comino\u8217\'20\'19s case, properties were poorly presented and development approval information which would have added value and broadened interest were excluded from marketing campaigns.\par \par \uc2 While Mr Comino said he understood his financial agreement with the bank required him to sell his assets if instructed by them, ANZ also had a duty to abide by the Corporations Act and Financial Services Act.\par \par \uc2 When forced to sell his assets, Mr Comino presented the bank with all written offers in good faith, trusting them to follow correct lending practices.\par \par \uc2 One of these was a simultaneous offer to sell the CBD Executive Apartments with $3.3 million cash and buy development land at Mackay Harbour with an existing Development Approval for $1.2 million.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino said this contract meant ANZ in forcing him to sell one property was also financing him for the purchase of a non-income producing property plus approximately $50,000 in stamp duty and fees.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI know the bank progressed a sale that was not economically viable for myself or the bank because they were desperate for money,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino said the bank stripped him of his lending facilities and cash flow two days after approving the $1.2 million loan to acquire the Mackay property.\par \par \uc2 The bank then imposed high default interest rates on the $1.2 million property.\par \par \uc2 There were also issues with the sales of Mr Comino\u8217\'20\'19s other property assets.\par \par \uc2 He claims the bank allowed receivers and agents to sell these other properties without disclosing their full and existing development approvals.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino believes this \u8220\'20\'1Ctotally misrepresented their true value\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 He said the bank spent more time drawing up a Deed of Agreement designed to give themselves immunity, rather than performing the due diligence and complying with statute laws.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe other root causes are valuations for bank purposes,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Comino said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt gives banks a lot of preference and ability to get their own desired outcome without consideration of the client.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CValuations for bank purposes compared to a normal valuation can be miles apart.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt destroys the ability for the owner of the property to achieve a fair and reasonable sale.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Inflated valuations have been explored by the inquiry. One western Queensland farmer told the commission a new loan to refinance his two cattle properties based on an incorrect valuation resulted in financial disaster.\par \par \uc2 Mr Comino has made a submission to the royal commission, but he believes there is little chance he will be invited to give evidence.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAt present there\u8217\'20\'19s something like 7337 claims, about 65 per cent of those were relating to banking misconduct,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHowever, only 16 cases have been invited to make a representation at the inquiry.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Regardless, he feels some sense of vindication in seeing strong evidence of systemic misconduct of banks and receivers revealed by the latest royal commission hearings.\par \par \uc2 He believes there are many more people with similar stories nation-wide who may not have the will or financial literacy to continue fighting for compensation.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe royal commission cannot be the terms of reference suggested by the banks and must include prudential regulation,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Comino said.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt is a complete and utter farce that the banks are dictating these terms and it\u8217\'20\'19s all smoke and mirrors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBanks cannot self-regulate any longer and need full and clear disclosures of products to the public.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFinancial literacy will mean nothing without honest details of fees, charges, trailing commissions and risk.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 An ANZ spokesman previously told The Morning Bulletin the bank did not comment on specifics of individual customers\u8217\'20\'19 banking details.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CANZ does not believe it has a case to answer in this matter and totally rejects the customer\u8217\'20\'19s allegations,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \cell \pard \ql

particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, which have high home price to income ratios.\par \par \uc2 Hobart, meanwhile, delivered the strongest annual house price growth of all capital cities at 15.9 per cent, continuing its trend of double-digit annual growth that started in early 2017.\par \par \uc2 "We're seeing a lot of capital from Melbourne and Sydney flow into Hobart ... as it offers relative affordability," Dr Powell said.\par \par \uc2 MEDIAN HOUSE PRICE YEAR ON YEAR GROWTH AT JUNE 2018:\par \par \uc2 National -

It was just that he was not entitled to do the work and lied about his qualifications," Mr McCabe said in his judgment.\par \par \uc2 "Provided I accept he has learned his lesson and addressed the defects in character and training that got him into trouble, there is no further danger to the investing public."\par \par \uc2 The \b \highlight22\uc2 banking royal commission\b0 \highlight\uc2  has been examining the provision of poor financial advice, prompting the closure of Dover Financial Group and forcing AMP to concede it lied to the regulator after charging fees for no service.\par \par \uc2 In circumstances Mr McCabe describes as "sad", Mr Williams enrolled in a university course but dropped out.\par \par \uc2 When the law changed in 2001 to require advisers to meet minimum educational standards, Mr McCabe had two years to comply.\par \par \uc2 He was at the time authorised to provide financial advice as a representative of Financial Services Partners, an ANZ subsidiary.\par \par \uc2 "As the deadline for obtaining the qualifications loomed in March 2004, Mr Williams informed Financial Services Partners that he had obtained a diploma," the judgment says. "It was a lie." In a statement to the tribunal, Mr Williams said he was struggling with the "pressures of young adulthood" and a complicated relationship with his father. "Once the lie was told, it took on a life of its own," the judgment says. "The deception would go on for years. He did not tell his father or his wife what he had done."\par \par \uc2 By 2014, new rules required Mr Williams to supply proof of his qualifications to be entered on the public register of financial advisers. He sent off forged certificates but realised "the game was up" when ANZ began a process to verify the qualifications.\par \par \uc2 Mr McCabe says while it was "disturbing" Mr Williams could lead a double life - "honest providers of financial services do not mislead their colleagues and family and customers about their qualifications, and they certainly do not forge documents" - his contrition is genuine.\par \par \uc2 But because he failed to comply with financial services laws, a six-year ban was appropriate.\par \par \uc2 "The harm did not include actual loss to anybody - although, as ASIC points out, members of the public were denied the opportunity to make an informed choice about the applicant's services," the judgment says.\par \par \uc2 "That is no small thing, but the applicant has not left a trail of financial ruin in his wake. That consideration counts in favour of a less stringent penalty than might otherwise be imposed if the applicant had done a bad job or caused financial loss."\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b CO\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 adappt : \uc2 Administrative Appeals Tribunal | ausic : \uc2 Australian Securities and Investments Commission\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 i83108 : \uc2 Investment Advice | i831 : \uc2 Financial Investments | ifinal : \uc2 Financial Services | iinv : \uc2 Investing/Securities\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 austr : \uc2 Australia | apacz : \uc2 Asia Pacific | ausnz : \uc2 Australia/Oceania\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 Fairfax Media Management Pty Limited\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document AFNR000020180725ee7q00014\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw293\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4395\pichgoal600

But here's the big question that, based on the tension in the room during Wright's panel, threatens to tear the sector apart: What sort of sector will these advisers be working in, five years on? While Wright said the sector needed fundamental change, he stirred emotions when he insisted the that the advice sector is not broken, and that most advisers were doing a good job for their clients.\par \par \uc2 That was disputed by Pamela Hanrahan, the deputy head of the University of New South Wales' school of business taxation, who pointed to industry surveys that showed three-quarters of advice did not demonstrate compliance with the requirement to act in the best interest of a client, and 10 per cent left the client worse off.\par \par \uc2 As Hanrahan, who is advising the royal commission, said: If there are good advisers, where are they?\par \par \uc2 Clare Mackay, the principal of independent advisory firm Quantum Financial, argued that suggesting that the bulk of financial advisers are doing a good job effectively creates a barrier to the reform the sector desperately needs.\par \par \uc2 For Mackay, the fundamental change is licensing individual advisers, rather than institutions; dual licensing of individual advisers and firms is something BT supports too.\par \par \uc2 For Hanrahan, adviser competency is key and other steps such as the banning of grandfathered commissions (a move that had brought support in the room) were important too.\par \par \uc2 The general thrust was that the sector needs to desperately professionalise if it is to win back the support of the community. Wright argued this would take time, and the adviser sector was only 30 or 40 years into a journey that surgeons, for example, had been on for 600 years.\par \par \uc2 He said BT would be working with universities and other bodies to try to bring through graduates who were highly skilled and passionate. But again this will take time, and as the chair of the session, Colin Tate, asked, will retirees want to take advice from a twentysomething?\par \par \uc2 The views in the room highlighted just how wrought the process of reform will be in this sector, and left some big questions on the table.\par \par \uc2 Will tweaking the structure of the advice sector really be enough, or are more wholesale changes needed?\par \par \uc2 Will the dismantling of vertical integration - should it happen - create other risks, such as removing the big capital buffers that the sector has enjoyed thanks to the fact advice businesses were owned by banks?\par \par \uc2 Will the process of professionalising the sector increase regulation and compliance costs to the point where smaller players are forced out of the sector, reducing competition and creating another set of risks?\par \par \uc2 It would appear that parts of the sector are a long away apart on the solutions, but at least there does appear unity on the speed with which reform is needed, and acceptance that it will probably hurt the sector badly.\par \par \uc2 And it was Mackay who delivered the session's best reminder of who needs to be put at the centre of solutions: "We all have jobs because of my clients."\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b CO\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 iafsal : \uc2 Australia Financial Services Council\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 austr : \uc2 Australia | apacz : \uc2 Asia Pacific | ausnz : \uc2 Australia/Oceania\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 Fairfax Media Management Pty Limited\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document AFNR000020180725ee7q0001d\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9072\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw189\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal2835\pichgoal600

The business owner said all their payments were up to date but they still received a threatening letter and it was later referred to the Industry Funds Credit Control, a debt collection agency. He said he got a letter of demand for more than $26,000. It was subsequently found to be wrong.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIf a bank were to behave in a similar way there would be a place to go and complain but with superannuation no agency seems to have responsibility,\u8221\'20\'1D the submission said.Mr Strong clarified that none of the other agencies appeared interested in taking up the issue. The submission also questioned why workers were forced into various industry funds.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {
